INTRODUCTORY</h2>
</div>


<p>To the eye or to the touch, ordinary matter appears to be continuous;
our dinner-table, or the chairs on which we sit, seem to present an
unbroken surface. We think that if there were too many holes the
chairs would not be safe to sit on. Science, however, compels us to
accept a quite different conception of what we are pleased to call
“solid” matter; it is, in fact, something much more like the Irishman’s
definition of a net, “a number of holes tied together with pieces of
string.” Only it would be necessary to imagine the strings cut away
until only the knots were left.</p>

<p>When science seeks to find the units of which matter is composed,
it is led to continually smaller particles. The largest unit is the
molecule, but a molecule is as a rule composed of “atoms” of several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
different “elements.” For example, a molecule of water consists of two
atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen, which can be separated from each
other by chemical methods. An atom, in its turn, is found to be a sort
of solar system, with a sun and planets; the empty regions between the
Sun and the planets fill up vastly more space than they do, so that
much the greater part of the volume that seems to us to be filled by a
solid body is really unoccupied. In the solar system that constitutes
an atom, the planets are called “electrons” and the Sun is called the
“nucleus.” The nucleus itself is not simple except in the case of
hydrogen; in all other cases, it is a complicated system consisting, in
all likelihood, of electrons and hydrogen nuclei (or protons, as they
are also called).</p>

<p>With electrons and hydrogen nuclei, so far as our present knowledge
extends, the possibility of dividing up matter into bits comes to
an end. No reason exists for supposing that these themselves have a
structure, and are composed of still smaller bits. We do not know, of
course, that reasons may not be found later for subdividing electrons
and hydrogen nuclei; we only know that so far nothing prevents us from
treating them as ultimate. It is difficult to know whether to be more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
astonished at the smallness of these units, or at the fact that there
are units, since we might have expected matter to be divisible <i>ad
infinitum</i>. It will help us to picture the world of atoms if we
have, to begin with, some idea of the size of these units. Let us start
with a gramme<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of hydrogen, which is not a very large quantity. How
many atoms will it contain? If the atoms were made up into bundles of a
million million, and then we took a million million of these bundles,
we should have about a gramme and a half of hydrogen. That is to say,
the weight of one atom of hydrogen is about a million-millionth of a
million-millionth of a gramme and a half. Other atoms weigh more than
the atom of hydrogen, but not enormously more; an atom of oxygen weighs
16 times as much, an atom of lead rather more than 200 times as much.
<i>Per contra</i>, an electron weighs very much less than a hydrogen
atom; it takes about 1850 electrons to weigh as much as one hydrogen
atom.</p>

<p>The space occupied by an atom is equally minute. As we shall see,
an atom of a given kind is not always of the same size; when it is
not crowded, the electrons which constitute its planets sometimes
are much farther from its sun than they are under normal terrestrial
conditions. But under normal conditions the diameter of a hydrogen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
atom is about a hundred-millionth of a centimetre (a centimetre is
about a third of an inch). That is to say, this is about twice the
usual distance of its one electron from the nucleus. The nucleus and
the electron themselves are very much smaller than the whole atom, just
as the Sun and the planets are smaller than the whole region occupied
by the solar system. The sizes of the electron and the nucleus are not
accurately known, but they are supposed to be about a hundred thousand
times as small as the whole atom.</p>

<p>It might be thought that not much could be known about such minute
phenomena, since they are very far below what can be seen by the most
powerful microscope. But in fact a great deal is known. What has been
discovered about atoms by modern physicists is doubly amazing. In the
first place, it is contrary to what every man of science expected,
and in part very difficult to reconcile with other knowledge and
with deep-seated prejudices. In the second place, it seems to the
layman hardly credible that such very small things should be not only
observable, but measurable with a high degree of accuracy. Sherlock
Holmes at his best did not show anything like the skill of the
physicists in making inferences, subsequently verified, from minute
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
facts which ordinary people would have thought unimportant. It is
remarkable that, like Einstein’s theory of gravitation, a great deal
of the work on the structure of the atom was done during the war. It
is probable that it will ultimately be used for making more deadly
explosives and projectiles than any yet invented.</p>

<p>The study of the way in which atoms combine into molecules belongs
to chemistry, and will not much concern us. We are concerned with
the structure of atoms, the way in which electrons and nuclei come
together to build up the various kinds of atoms. This study belongs to
physics almost entirely. There are three methods by which most of our
knowledge is obtained: the spectroscope, X-rays, and radio-activity.
The hydrogen atom, which has a simple nucleus and only one electron, is
studied by means of the spectroscope almost alone. This is the easiest
case, and the only one in which the mathematical difficulties can be
solved completely. It is the case by means of which the most important
principles were discovered and accurately tested. All the atoms except
that of hydrogen present some problems which are too difficult for the
mathematicians, in spite of the fact that they are largely of a kind
that has been studied ever since the time of Newton. But although
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
exact quantitative solutions of the questions that arise are often
impossible, it is not impossible, even with the more complex atoms, to
discover the sort of thing that is happening when they emit light or
X-rays or radio-activity.</p>

<p>When an atom has many electrons, it seems that they are arranged
in successive rings round the nucleus, all revolving round it
approximately in circles or ellipses. (An ellipse is an oval curve,
which may be described as a flattened-out circle.) The chemical
properties of the atom depend, almost entirely, upon the outer ring; so
does the light that it emits, which is studied by the spectroscope. The
inner rings of electrons give rise to X-rays when they are disturbed,
and it is chiefly by means of X-rays that their constitution is
studied. The nucleus itself is the source of radio-activity. In radium
and the other radio-active elements, the nucleus is unstable, and is
apt to shoot out little particles with incredible velocity. As the
nucleus is what really determines what sort of atom is concerned, i.e.
what element the atom belongs to, an atom which has ejected particles
in radio-activity has changed its chemical nature, and is no longer the
same element as it was before. Radio-activity has only been found among
the heaviest atoms, which have the most complex structure. The fact
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
that it occurs is one of the proofs that the nucleus of such elements
has a structure and is complex. Until radio-activity was discovered,
no process was known which changed one element into another.
Now-a-days, transmutation, the dream of the alchemists, takes place in
laboratories. But unfortunately it does not transform the baser metals
into gold; it transforms radium, which is infinitely more valuable than
gold, into lead—of a sort.</p>

<p>The simplest atom is that of hydrogen, which has a simple nucleus and
a single electron. Even the one electron is lost when the atom is
positively electrified: a positively electrified hydrogen atom consists
of a hydrogen nucleus alone. The most complex atom known is that of
uranium, which has, in its normal state, 92 electrons revolving round
the nucleus, while the nucleus itself probably consists of 238 hydrogen
nuclei and 146 electrons. No reason is known why there should not be
still more complex atoms, and possibly such atoms may be discovered
some day. But all the most complex atoms known are breaking down into
simpler ones by radio-activity, so that one may guess that still more
complex atoms could not be stable enough to exist in discoverable
quantities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>The amount of energy packed up in an atom is amazing, considering its
minuteness. There is least energy in the outer electrons, which are
concerned in chemical processes, and yield, for instance, the energy
derived from combustion. There is more in the inner electrons, which
yield X-rays. But there is most in the nucleus itself. This energy in
the nucleus only came to be known through radio-activity; it is the
energy which is used up in the performances of radium. The nucleus
of any atom except hydrogen is a tight little system, which may be
compared to a family of energetic people engaged in a perpetual family
quarrel. In radio-activity some members of the family emigrate, and
it is found that the energy they used to spend on quarrels at home
is sufficient to govern an empire. If this source of energy can be
utilized commercially, it will probably in time supersede every other.
Rutherford—to whom, more than any other single man, is due the
conception of the atom as a solar system of electrons revolving round
a nucleus—is working on this subject, and investigating experimental
methods of breaking up complex atoms into two or more simpler ones.
This happens naturally in radio-activity, but only a few elements
are radio-active, at any rate to an extent that we can discover. To
establish the modern theory of the structure of nuclei on a firm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
basis, it is necessary to show, by artificial methods, that atoms which
are not naturally radio-active can also be split up. For this purpose,
Rutherford has subjected nitrogen atoms (and others) to a severe
bombardment, and has succeeded in detaching hydrogen atoms from them.
This whole investigation is as yet in its infancy. The outcome may in
time revolutionize industry, but at present this is no more than a
speculative possibility.</p>

<p>One of the most astonishing things about the processes that take place
in atoms is that they seem to be liable to sudden discontinuities,
sudden jumps from one state of continuous motion to another. This
motion of an electron round its nucleus seems to be like that of a
flea, which crawls for a while, and then hops. The crawls proceed
accurately according to the old laws of dynamics, but the hops are a
new phenomenon, concerning which certain totally new laws have been
discovered empirically, without any possibility (so far as can be seen)
of connecting them with the old laws. There is a possibility that the
old laws, which represented motion as a smooth continuous process,
may be only statistical averages, and that, when we come down to a
sufficiently minute scale, everything really proceeds by jumps, like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
the cinema, which produces a misleading appearance of continuous motion
by means of a succession of separate pictures.</p>

<p>In the following chapters, I shall try to explain in non-technical
language what is known about the structure of atoms and how it has
been discovered, in so far as this is possible without introducing
any mathematical or other difficulties. Although a great deal is
known, a great deal more is still unknown; at any moment, important
new knowledge may be discovered. The subject is almost as interesting
through the possibilities which it suggests as through what has
actually been ascertained already; it is impossible to exaggerate the
revolutionary effect which it may have both in the practice of industry
and in the theory of physics.</p>

THE PERIODIC LAW</h2>
</div>


<p>BEFORE we can understand the modern work on the structure of the atom,
it is necessary to know something of the different kinds of atoms
as they appear in chemistry. As every one knows, there are a great
many different chemical “elements.” The number known at present is
eighty-eight, but new elements are discovered from time to time. The
last discovery of a new element was announced as recently as January
22nd of this year (1923). This element was discovered in Copenhagen
and has been christened hafnium. Each element consists of atoms of
a special kind. As we saw in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I</a>, an atom is a kind of solar
system, consisting of a nucleus which has electrons revolving round
it. We shall see later that it is the nature of the nucleus that
characterizes an element, and that two atoms of the same element may
differ as to the number of their electrons and the shapes of their
orbits. But for the present we are not concerned with the insides of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
atoms: we are taking them as units, in the way that chemistry takes
them, and studying their outward behaviour.</p>

<p>The word “atom” originally meant “indivisible” and comes to us from
the Greeks, some of whom believed that matter is composed of little
particles which cannot be cut up. We know now that what are called
atoms can be cut up, except in the case of positively electrified
hydrogen (which consists of a hydrogen nucleus without any attendant
electron). But in chemistry, apart from radio-activity, there is
nothing to prove that atoms can be divided. So long as we could only
study atoms by the methods of chemistry, that is to say, by their
ways of combining with other atoms to form compounds, there was no
way in which we could reach smaller units of matter out of which the
atoms could be composed. Everything known before the discovery of
radio-activity pointed to the view that an atom is indestructible,
and this made it difficult to see how atoms could have a structure
built out of smaller things, because, if they had, one would expect
to find that the structure could be destroyed, just as a house can
be knocked down and reduced to a heap of bricks. We now know that in
radio-activity this sort of thing does happen. Moreover it has proved
possible, by means of the spectroscope, to discover with delicate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
precision all sorts of facts about the structure of the atom which were
quite unknown until recent years.</p>

<p>It was of course recognized that science could not rest content with
the theory that there were just eighty-eight different sorts of atoms.
We could bring ourselves to believe that the universe is built out of
two different sorts of things, or perhaps three; we could believe that
it is built out of an infinite number of different sorts of things.
But some instinct rebels against the idea of its being built out of
eighty-eight different sorts of things. The physicists have now all
but succeeded in reducing matter to two different kinds of units, one
(the proton or hydrogen nucleus) bearing positive electricity, and
the other (the electron) bearing negative electricity. It is fairly
certain that this reduction will prove to be right, but whether there
is any further stage to be hoped for it is as yet impossible to say.
What we can already say definitely is that the haphazard multiplicity
of the chemical elements has given place to something more unified
and systematic. The first step in this process, without which the
later steps cannot be understood, was taken by the Russian chemist
Mendeleeff, who discovered the “periodic law” of the elements.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>The periodic law was discovered about the year 1870. At the time when
it was discovered, the evidence for it was far less complete than it
is at present. It has proved itself capable of predicting new elements
which have subsequently been found, and altogether the half-century
that has passed since its discovery has enormously enhanced its
importance. The elements can be arranged in a series by means of what
is called their “atomic weight.” By chemical methods, we can remove
one element from a compound and replace it by an equal number of atoms
of another element; we can observe how much this alters the weight of
the compound, and thus we can compare the weight of one kind of atom
with the weight of another. The lightest atom is that of hydrogen;
the heaviest is that of uranium, which weighs over 238 times as much
as that of hydrogen. It was found that, taking the weight of the
hydrogen atom as one, the weights of a great many other atoms were
almost exactly multiples of this unit, so that they were expressed by
integers. The weight of the oxygen atom is a very little less than
16 times that of the hydrogen atom. It has been found convenient
to <i>define</i> the atomic weight of oxygen at 16, so that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
atomic weight of hydrogen becomes slightly more than one (1.008). The
advantage of this definition is that it makes the atomic weights of
a great many elements whole numbers, within the limits of accuracy
that are possible in measurement. The recent work of F. W. Aston on
what are called “isotopes” (concerning which we shall have more to
say at a later stage) has shown that, in many cases where the atomic
weight seems to be not a whole number, we really have a mixture of two
different elements, each of which has a whole number for its atomic
weight. This is what we should expect if the nuclei of the heavier
atoms are composed of the nuclei of hydrogen atoms together with
electrons (which are very much lighter than hydrogen nuclei). The fact
that so many atomic weights are almost exactly whole numbers cannot be
due to chance, and has long been regarded as a reason for supposing
that atoms are built up out of smaller units.</p>

<p>Mendeleeff (and at about the same time the German chemist, Lothar
Meyer) observed that an element would resemble in its properties, not
those that came next to it in the series of atomic weights, but certain
other elements which came at periodic intervals in the series. For
example, there is a group of elements called “alkalis”; these are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
the 3rd, 11th, 19th, etc. in the series. These are all very similar
in their chemical behaviour, and also in certain physical respects,
notably their spectrum. Next to these come a group called “alkaline
earths”; these are the 4th, 12th, 20th, etc. in the series. The third
group are called “earths.” There are eight such groups in all. The
eighth, which was not known when the law was discovered, is the very
interesting group of “inert gases,” Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton,
Xenon, and Niton, all discovered since the time of Mendeleeff. These
are the 2nd, 10th, 18th, 36th, 54th and 86th respectively in the series
of elements. They all have the property that they will not enter into
chemical combinations with any other elements; the Germans, on this
account, call them the “noble” gases. The elements from an alkali to
the next inert gas form what is called one “period.” There are seven
periods altogether.</p>

<p>When once the periodic law had been discovered, it was found that a
great many properties of elements were periodic. This gave a principle
of arrangement of the elements, which in the immense majority of cases
placed them in the order of their atomic weights, but in a few cases
reversed this order on account of other properties. For example, argon,
which is an inert gas, has the atomic weight 39.88, whereas potassium,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
which is an alkali, has the smaller atomic weight 39.10. Accordingly
argon, in spite of its greater atomic weight, has to be placed before
potassium, at the end of the third period, while potassium has to be
put at the beginning of the fourth. It has been found that, when the
order derived from the periodic law differs from that derived from the
atomic weight, the order derived from the periodic law is much more
important; consequently this order is always adopted.</p>

<p>When the periodic law was first discovered, there were a great many
gaps in the series, that is to say, the law indicated that there ought
to be an element with such-and-such properties at a certain point
in the series, but no such element was known. Confidence in the law
was greatly strengthened by the discovery of new elements having the
requisite properties. There are now only four gaps remaining.</p>

<p>The seven periods are of very unequal length. The first contains only
two elements, hydrogen and helium. The second and third each contain
eight; the fourth contains eighteen, the fifth again contains eighteen,
the sixth thirty-two, and the seventh only six. But the seventh, which
consists of radio-active elements, is incomplete; its later members
would presumably be unstable, and break down by radio-activity. Niels
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Bohr<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> suggests that, if it were complete, it would again contain
thirty-two elements, like the sixth period.</p>

<p>By means of the periodic law, the elements are placed in a series,
beginning with hydrogen and ending with uranium. Counting the four
gaps, there are ninety-two places in the series. What is called the
“atomic number” of an element is simply its place in this series. Thus
hydrogen has the atomic number 1, and uranium has the atomic number 92.
Helium is 2, lithium is 3, carbon 6, nitrogen 7, oxygen 8, and so on.
Radium, which fits quite correctly into the series, is 88. The atomic
number is much more important than the atomic weight; we shall find
that it has a very simple interpretation in the structure of the atom.</p>

<p>It has lately been discovered that there are sometimes two or more
slightly different elements having the same atomic number. Such
elements are exactly alike in their chemical properties, their optical
spectra, and even their X-ray spectra; they differ in no observable
property except their atomic weight. It is owing to their extreme
similarity that they were not distinguished sooner. Two elements which
have the same atomic number are called “isotopes.” We shall return to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
them when we come to the subject of radio-activity, when it will appear
that their existence ought not to surprise us. For the present we shall
ignore them, and regard as identical two elements having the same
atomic number.</p>

<p>There are irregularities in the periodicity of the elements, which we
are only now beginning to understand. The second and third periods,
which each contain eight elements, are quite regular; the first element
in the one is like the first in the other, the second like the second
and so on. But the fourth period has 18 elements, so that its elements
cannot correspond one by one to those of the third period. There are
eight elements with new properties (the 21st to the 28th), and others
in which the correspondence is not exact. The fifth period corresponds
regularly, element for element, with the fourth, which is possible
because both contain 18 elements. But in the sixth period there are 36
elements, and 16 of these (the “rare earths” as they are called) do not
correspond to any of the elements in earlier periods. Niels Bohr, in
the book mentioned above, has offered ingenious explanations of these
apparent irregularities, which are still more or less hypothetical, but
are probably in the main correct. Some very important facts, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
remain quite unexplained, notably the fact that iron and the two
neighbouring elements have magnetic properties which are different in a
remarkable way from those of all other elements.</p>

<p>The atomic weight of the earlier elements (except hydrogen) is double,
or one more than double, the atomic number. Thus helium, the second
element, has the atomic weight 4; lithium, the third, has the atomic
weight 7 (very nearly); oxygen, the eighth, has the atomic weight 16.
But after the 20th element the atomic weight becomes increasingly more
than double the atomic number. For instance, silver, the 47th element,
has atomic weight 107.88; gold, the 79th, has atomic weight 197.2;
uranium, the 92nd, has atomic weight 238.2.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that X-ray spectra, which were unknown until a few
years ago, show a perfectly regular progression throughout the whole
series of elements, even in those cases where the order of the periodic
table departs from the order of the atomic weights. This is a striking
confirmation of the correctness of the order that has been adopted.</p>

<p>The fact of the periodic relations among the elements, and of
progressive properties such as those shown in X-ray spectra (which
we shall consider later on), is enough to make it highly probable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
that there are relations between different kinds of atoms, of a sort
which implies that they are all built out of common materials, which
must be regarded as the true “atoms” in the philosophical sense,
i.e. the indivisible constituents of all matter. Chemical atoms are
not indivisible, but are composed of simpler constituents which
are indivisible, so far as our present knowledge goes. Without the
knowledge of the periodic law, it is probable that the modern theories
of the constitution of atoms would never have been discovered; <i>per
contra</i>, the facts embodied in the periodic law form an essential
part of the basis for these theories. The broad lines of atomic
constitution will be explained in the next chapter.</p>

ELECTRONS AND NUCLEI</h2>
</div>


<p>AN atom, as we saw in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I</a>, consists, like the solar system, of
a number of planets moving round a central body, the planets being
called “electrons” and the central body a “nucleus.” But the planets
are not attached as firmly to the central body as they are in the solar
system. Sometimes, under outside influences, a planet flies off, and
either becomes attached to some other system, or wanders about for a
while as a free electron. Under certain circumstances, the path of a
free electron can actually be photographed; so can the paths of helium
nuclei that are momentarily destitute of attendant electrons. This is
done by making them travel through water vapour, which enables each
to collect a little cloud, and so become large enough to be visible
with a powerful microscope. These observations of individual electrons
and helium nuclei are extraordinarily instructive. They travel most
of their journey in nearly straight lines, but are liable to sudden
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
deviations when they find themselves very near to the electrons or
nuclei of atoms that stand in their way. Helium nuclei are much less
easily deflected from the straight line than electrons, showing that
they have much greater mass. By exposing these particles to electric
and magnetic forces and observing the effect upon their motion, it is
possible to calculate their velocity and their mass. By one means or
another, it is possible to find out just as much about them as we can
find out about larger bodies.</p>

<p>An atom differs from the solar system by the fact that it is not
gravitation that makes the electrons go round the nucleus, but
electricity. As everybody knows, there are two kinds of electricity,
positive and negative. (These are mere names; the two kinds might just
as well be called “A” and “B.” None of the ideas commonly associated
with the words “positive” and “negative” must be allowed to intrude
when we speak of positive and negative electricity.) Each kind of
electricity attracts its opposite and repels its own kind, like male
and female. It is very easy to see electrical attraction in operation.
For instance, take a piece of sealing-wax and rub it for a while on
your sleeve. You will find that it will pick up small bits of paper
if it is held a little distance above them, just as a magnet will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
pick up a needle. The sealing-wax attracts the bits of paper because
it has become electrified by friction. In a similar way, the central
nucleus of an atom, which consists of positive electricity, attracts
the electrons, which consist of negative electricity. The law of
attraction is the same as in the solar system: the nearer the nucleus
and the electron are to each other the greater is the attraction, and
the attraction increases faster than the distance diminishes. At half
the distance, there is four times the attraction; at a third of the
distance, nine times; at a quarter, sixteen times, and so on. This is
what is called the law of the inverse square. But whereas the planets
of the solar system attract one another, the electrons in an atom,
since they all have negative electricity, repel one another, again
according to the law of the inverse square.</p>

<p>Some readers may expect me at this stage to tell them what electricity
“really is.” The fact is that I have already said what it is. It is
not a thing, like St. Paul’s Cathedral; it is a way in which things
behave. When we have told how things behave when they are electrified,
and under what circumstances they are electrified, we have told all
there is to tell. When we are speaking of large bodies, there are three
states possible: they may be more or less positively electrified,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
or more or less negatively electrified, or neutral. Ordinary bodies
at ordinary times are neutral, but in a thunderstorm the earth and
the clouds have opposite kinds of electricity. Ordinary bodies are
neutral because their small parts contain equal amounts of positive and
negative electricity; the smallest parts, the electrons and nuclei,
are never neutral, the electrons always having negative electricity
and the nuclei always having positive electricity. That means simply
that electrons repel electrons, nuclei repel nuclei, and nuclei attract
electrons, according to certain laws; that they behave in a certain way
in a magnetic field; and so on. When we have enumerated these laws of
behaviour, there is nothing more to be said about electricity, unless
we can discover further laws, or simplify and unify the statement of
the laws already known. When I say that an electron has a certain
amount of negative electricity, I mean merely that it behaves in a
certain way. Electricity is not like red paint, a substance which
can be put on to the electron and taken off again; it is merely a
convenient name for certain physical laws.</p>

<p>All electrons, whatever kind of atom they may belong to, and also
if they are not attached to any atom, are exactly alike—so far, at
least, as the most delicate tests can discover. Any two electrons
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
have exactly the same amount of negative electricity, the smallest
amount that can exist. They all have the same mass. (This is not the
mass directly obtained from measurement, because when an electron is
moving very fast its measured mass increases. This is true, not only of
electrons, but of all bodies, for reasons explained by the theory of
relativity, which will concern us at a later stage. But with ordinary
bodies the effect is inappreciable, because they all move very much
slower than light. Electrons, on the contrary, have been sometimes
observed to move with velocities not much less than that of light; they
can even reach 99 per cent, of the velocity of light. At this speed,
the increase of measured mass is very great. But when we introduce
the correction demanded by the theory of relativity, it is found that
the mass of any two electrons is the same.) Electrons also all have
the same size, in so far as they can be said to have a definite size.
(For reasons which will appear later, the notion of the “size” of an
electron is not so definite as we should be inclined to think.) They
are the ultimate constituents of negative electricity, and one of the
two kinds of ultimate constituents of matter.</p>

<p>Nuclei, on the contrary, are different for different kinds of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
elements. We will begin with hydrogen, which is the simplest element.
The nucleus of the hydrogen atom has an amount of positive electricity
exactly equal to the amount of negative electricity on an electron. It
has, however, a great deal more ordinary mass (or weight); in fact,
it is about 1850 times as heavy as an electron, so that practically
all the weight of the atom is due to the nucleus. When positive and
negative electricity are present in equal amounts in a body, they
neutralize each other from the point of view of the outside world, and
the body appears as unelectrified. When a body appears as electrified,
that is because there is a preponderance of one kind of electricity.
The hydrogen atom, when it is unelectrified, consists simply of a
hydrogen nucleus with one electron. If it loses its electron, it
becomes positively electrified. Most kinds of atoms are capable of
various degrees of positive electrification, but the hydrogen atom is
only capable of one perfectly definite amount. This is part of the
evidence for the view that it has only one electron in its neutral
condition. If it had two in its neutral condition, the amount of
positive electricity in the nucleus would have to be equal to the
amount of negative electricity in two electrons, and the hydrogen atom
could acquire a double charge of positive electricity by losing both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
its electrons. This sometimes happens with the helium atom, and with
the heavier atoms, but never with the hydrogen atom.</p>

<p>Under normal conditions, when the hydrogen atom is unelectrified, the
electron simply continues to go round and round the nucleus, just
as the earth continues to go round and round the sun. The electron
may move in any one of a certain set of orbits, some larger, some
smaller, some circular, some elliptical. (We shall consider these
different orbits presently.) But when the atom is undisturbed, it has
a preference for the smallest of the circular orbits, in which, as we
saw in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I</a>, the distance between the nucleus and the electron is
about half a hundred-millionth of a centimetre. It goes round in this
tiny orbit with very great rapidity; in fact its velocity is about a
hundred-and-thirty-fourth of the velocity of light, which is 300,000
kilometres (about 180,000 miles) a second. Thus the electron manages to
cover about 2,200 kilometres (or about 1400 miles) in every second. To
do this, it has to go round its tiny orbit about seven thousand million
times in a millionth of a second; that is to say, in a millionth of
a second it has to live through about seven thousand million of its
“years.” The modern man is supposed to have a passion for rapid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
motion, but nature far surpasses him in this respect.</p>

<p>It is odd that, although the hydrogen nucleus is very much heavier than
an electron, it is probably no larger. The dimensions of an electron
are estimated at about a hundred thousandth of the dimensions of its
orbit. This, however, is not to be taken as a statement with a high
degree of accuracy; it merely gives the sort of size that we are to
think of. As for the nucleus, we know that in the case of hydrogen, it
is probably about the same size as an electron, but we do not know this
for certain. The hydrogen nucleus may be quite without structure, like
an electron, but the nuclei of other elements have a structure, and are
probably built up out of hydrogen nuclei and electrons.</p>

<p>As we pass up the periodic series of the elements, the positive
charge of electricity in the nucleus increases by one unit with each
step. Helium, the second element in the table, has exactly twice as
much positive electricity in its nucleus as there is in the nucleus
of hydrogen; lithium, the third element, has three times as much;
oxygen, the eighth, has eight times as much; uranium, the ninety-second
(counting the gaps), has ninety-two times as much. Corresponding to
this increase in the positive electricity of the nucleus, the atom in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
its unelectrified state has more electrons revolving round the nucleus.
Helium has two electrons, lithium three, and so on, until we come to
uranium, like the Grand Turk, with ninety-two consorts revolving round
him. In this way the negative electricity of the electrons exactly
balances the positive electricity of the nucleus, and the atom as a
whole is electrically neutral. When, by any means, an atom is robbed
of one of its electrons, it becomes positively electrified; if it is
robbed of two electrons, it becomes doubly electrified and remains
electrified until it has an opportunity of annexing from elsewhere as
many electrons as it has lost. A body can be negatively electrified by
containing free electrons; an atom may for a short time have more than
its proper number of electrons, and thus become negatively electrified,
but this is an unstable condition, except in chemical combinations.</p>

<p>Nobody knows exactly how the electrons are arranged in other atoms
than hydrogen. Even with helium, which has only two electrons, the
mathematical problems are too difficult to be solved completely; and
when we come to atoms that have a multitude of electrons, we are
reduced largely to guesswork. But there is reason to think that the
electrons are arranged more or less in rings, the inner rings being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
nearer to the nucleus than the outer ones. We know that the electrons
must all revolve about the nucleus in orbits which are roughly circles
or ellipses, but they will be perturbed from the circular or elliptic
path by the repulsions of the other electrons. In the solar system,
the attractions which the planets exercise upon each other are very
minute compared to the attraction of the sun, so that each planet moves
very nearly as if there were no other planets. But the electrical
forces between two electrons are not very much less strong than the
forces between electrons and nucleus at the same distance. In the case
of helium, they are half as strong; with lithium, a third as strong,
and so on. This makes the perturbations much greater than they are in
the solar system, and the mathematics correspondingly more difficult.
Moreover we cannot actually observe the orbits of the electrons, as we
can those of the planets; we can only infer them by calculations based
upon data derived mainly from the spectrum of the element concerned,
including the X-ray spectrum.</p>

<p>We shall have more to say at a later stage about the nature of these
rings, which cannot be as simple as was supposed at first. The
first hypothesis was that the electrons were like the people in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
merry-go-round, all going round in circles, some in a small circle near
the centre, others in a larger circle, others in a still larger one.
But for various reasons the arrangement cannot be as simple as that.
In spite of uncertainties of detail, however, it remains practically
certain that there are successive rings of electrons: one ring in
atoms belonging to the first period, two in the second period, three
in the third, and so on. Each period begins with an alkali, which has
only one electron in the outermost ring, and ends with an inert gas,
which has as many electrons in the outermost ring as it can hold. It
is impossible to get a ring to hold more than a certain number of
electrons, though it has been suggested by Niels Bohr, in an extremely
ingenious speculation, that a ring can hold more electrons when it
has other rings outside it than when it is the outer ring. His theory
accounts extraordinarily well for the peculiarities of the periodic
table, and is therefore worth understanding, though it cannot yet be
regarded as certainly true.</p>

<p>The previous view was that each ring, when complete, held as many
electrons as there are elements in the corresponding period. Thus
the first period contains only two elements (hydrogen and helium);
therefore the innermost ring, which is completed in the helium atom,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
must contain two electrons. This remains true on Bohr’s theory. The
second period consists of eight elements, and is completed when we
reach neon. The unelectrified atom of neon therefore, will have two
electrons in the inner ring and eight in the outer. The third period
again consists of eight elements, ending with argon; therefore argon,
in its neutral state, will have a third ring consisting of a further
eight electrons. So far, we have not reached the parts of the periodic
table in which there are irregularities, and therefore Bohr accepts
the current view, except for certain refinements which need not
concern us at present. But in the fourth period, which consists of
18 elements, there are a number of elements which do not correspond
to earlier ones in their chemical and spectroscopic properties. Bohr
accounts for this by supposing that the new electrons are not all in
the new outermost ring, but are some of them in the third ring, which
is able to hold more when it has other electrons outside it. Thus
krypton, the inert gas which completes the fourth period, will still
have only eight electrons in its outer ring, but will have eighteen in
the third ring. Some elements in the fourth period differ from their
immediate predecessors, not as regards the outer ring, but by having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
one more electron in the third ring. These are the elements that do not
correspond accurately to any elements in the third period. Similarly
the fifth period, which again consists of 18 elements, will add its new
electrons partly in the new fifth ring, partly in the fourth, ending
with xenon, which will have eight electrons in the fifth ring, eighteen
in the fourth, and the other rings as in krypton. In the sixth period,
which has 32 elements, the new electrons are added partly in the sixth
ring, partly in the fifth, and partly in the fourth; the rare earths
are the elements which add new electrons in the fourth ring. Niton,
the inert gas which ends the sixth period, will, according to Bohr’s
theory, have its first three rings the same as those of krypton and
xenon, but its fourth ring will have 32 electrons, its fifth 18, and
its sixth eight. This theory has very interesting niceties, which,
however, cannot be explained at our present stage.</p>

<p>The chemical properties of an element depend almost entirely upon the
outer ring of electrons, and that is why they are periodic. If we
accept Bohr’s theory, the outer ring, when it is completed, always has
eight electrons, except in hydrogen and helium. There is a tendency for
atoms to combine so as to make up the full number of electrons in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
outer ring. Thus an alkali, which has one electron in the outer ring,
will combine readily with an element that comes just before an inert
gas, and so has one less electron in the outer ring than it can hold.
An element which has two electrons in the outer ring will combine with
an element next but one before an inert gas, and so on. Two atoms of
an alkali will combine with one atom of an element next but one before
an inert gas. An inert gas, which has its outer ring already complete,
will not combine with anything.</p>

THE HYDROGEN SPECTRUM</h2>
</div>


<p>THE general lines of atomic structure which have been sketched
in previous chapters have resulted largely from the study of
radio-activity, together with the theory of X-rays and the facts
of chemistry. The general picture of the atom as a solar system of
electrons revolving about a nucleus of positive electricity is derived
from a mass of evidence, the interpretation of which is largely due
to Rutherford; to him also is due a great deal of our knowledge of
radio-activity and of the structure of nuclei. But the most surprising
and intimate secrets of the atom have been discovered by means of
the spectroscope. That is to say, the spectroscope has supplied the
experimental facts, but the interpretation of the facts required an
extraordinarily brilliant piece of theorizing by a young Dane, Niels
Bohr, who, when he first propounded his theory (1913), was still
working under Rutherford. The original theory has since been modified
and developed, notably by Sommerfeld, but everything that has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
done since has been built upon the work of Bohr. This chapter and the
next will be concerned with his theory in its original and simplest
form.</p>

<p>When the light of the sun is made to pass through a prism, it becomes
separated by refraction into the different colours of the rainbow.
The spectroscope is an instrument for effecting this separation into
different colours for sunlight or for any other light that passes
through it. The separated colours are called a spectrum, so that a
spectroscope is an instrument for seeing a spectrum. The essential
feature of the spectroscope is the prism through which the light
passes, which refracts different colours differently, and so makes
them separately visible. The rainbow is a natural spectrum, caused by
refraction of sunlight in raindrops.</p>

<p>When a gas is made to glow, it is found by means of the spectroscope
that the light which it emits may be of two sorts. One sort gives a
spectrum which is a continuous band of colours, like a rainbow; the
other sort consists of a number of sharp lines of single colours. The
first sort, which are called “band-spectra,” are due to molecules;
the second sort, called “line-spectra,” are due to atoms. The first
sort will not further concern us; it is from line-spectra that our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
knowledge of atomic constitution is obtained.</p>

<p>When white light is passed through a gas that is not glowing, and then
analysed by the spectroscope, it is found that there are dark lines,
which are to a great extent (though not by any means completely)
identical with the bright lines that were emitted by the glowing gas.
These dark lines are called the “absorption-spectrum” of the gas,
whereas the bright lines are called the “emission-spectrum.”</p>

<p>Every element has its characteristic spectrum, by which its presence
may be detected. The spectrum, as we shall see, depends in the main
upon the electrons in the outer ring. When an atom is positively
electrified by being robbed of an electron in the outer ring, its
spectrum is changed, and becomes very similar to that of the preceding
element in the periodic table. Thus positively electrified helium has
a spectrum closely similar to that of hydrogen—so similar that for a
long time it was mistaken for that of hydrogen.</p>

<p>The spectra of elements known in the laboratory are found in the sun
and the stars, thus enabling us to know a great deal about the chemical
constitution of even the most distant fixed stars. This was the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
great discovery made by means of the spectroscope.</p>

<p>The application of the spectroscope that concerns us is different. We
are concerned with the explanation of the lines emitted by different
elements. Why does an element have a spectrum consisting of certain
sharp lines? What connection is there between the different lines in a
single spectrum? Why are the lines sharp instead of being diffuse bands
of colours? Until recent years, no answer whatever was known to these
questions; now the answer is known with a considerable approach to
completeness. In the two cases of hydrogen and positively electrified
helium, the answer is exhaustive; everything has been explained,
down to the tiniest peculiarities. It is quite clear that the same
principles that have been successful in those two cases are applicable
throughout, and in part the principles have been shown to yield
observed results; but the mathematics involved in the case of atoms
that have many electrons is too difficult to enable us to deduce their
spectra completely from theory, as we can in the simplest cases. In
the cases that can be worked out, the calculations are not difficult.
Those who are not afraid of a little mathematics can find an outline
in Norman Campbell’s “Series Spectra” (Cambridge, 1921), and a fuller
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
account in Sommerfeld’s “Atomic Structures and Spectral Lines,” of
which an English translation is published by E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., New
York, and Methuen in London.</p>

<p>As every one knows, light consists of waves. Light-waves are
distinguished from sound-waves by being what is called “transverse,”
whereas sound-waves are what is called “longitudinal.” It is easy
to explain the difference by an illustration. Suppose a procession
marching up Piccadilly. From time to time the police will make them
halt in Piccadilly Circus; whenever this happens, the people behind
will press up until they too have to halt, and a wave of stoppage will
travel all down the procession. When the people in front begin to move
on, they will thin out, and the process of thinning out will travel
down the whole procession just as the previous process of condensation
did. This is what a sound-wave is like; it is called a “longitudinal”
wave, because the people move all the time in the same direction in
which the wave moves. But now suppose a mounted policeman, whose duty
it is to keep half the road clear, rides along the right-hand edge
of the procession. As he approaches, the people on the right will
move to the left, and this movement to the left will travel along the
procession as the policeman rides on. This is a “transverse” wave,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
because, while the wave travels straight on, the people move from
right to left, at right angles to the direction in which the wave is
travelling. This is the way a light-wave is constructed; the vibration
which makes the wave is at right angles to the direction in which the
wave is travelling.</p>

<p>This is, of course, not the only difference between light-waves and
sound-waves. Sound waves only travel about a mile in five seconds,
whereas light-waves travel about 180,000 miles a second. Sound-waves
consist of vibrations of the air, or of whatever material medium is
transmitting them, and cannot be propagated in a vacuum; whereas
light-waves require no material medium. People have invented a medium,
the æther, for the express purpose of transmitting light-waves. Put all
we really know is that the waves are transmitted; the æther is purely
hypothetical, and does not really add anything to our knowledge. We
know the mathematical properties of light-waves, and the sensations
they produce when they reach the human eye, but we do not know what it
is that undulates. We only suppose that something must undulate because
we find it difficult to imagine waves otherwise.</p>

<p>Different colours of the rainbow have different wave-lengths, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
is to say, different distances between the crest of one wave and
the crest of the next. Of the visible colours, red has the greatest
wave-length and violet the smallest. But there are longer and shorter
waves, just like those that make light, except that our eyes are not
adapted for seeing them. The longest waves of this sort that we know
of are those used in wireless-telegraphy, which sometimes have a
wave-length of several miles. X-rays are rays of the same sort as those
that make visible light, but very much shorter; y-rays, which occur
in radio-activity, are still shorter, and are the shortest we know.
Many waves that are too long or too short to be seen can nevertheless
be photographed. In speaking of the spectrum of an element, we do not
confine ourselves to visible colours, but include all experimentally
discoverable waves of the same sort as those that make visible colours.
The X-ray spectra, which are in some ways peculiarly instructive,
require quite special methods, and are a recent discovery, beginning
in 1912. Between the wave-lengths of wireless-telegraphy and those of
visible light there is a vast gap; the wave-lengths of ordinary light
(including ultra-violet) are between a ten-thousandth and about a
hundred-thousandth of a centimetre. There is another long gap between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
visible light and X-rays, which are on the average composed of waves
about ten thousand times shorter than those that make visible light.
The gap between X-rays and <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.229ex; height: 1.486ex;" src="images/17.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\gamma">-rays is not large.</p>

<p>In studying the connection between the different lines in the spectrum
of an element, it is convenient to characterize a wave, not by its
wave-length, but by its “wave-number,” which means the number of waves
in a centimetre. Thus if the wave-length is one ten-thousandth of
a centimetre, the wave-number is 10,000; if the wave-length is one
hundred-thousandth of a centimetre, the wave-number is 100,000, and
so on. The shorter the wave-length, the greater is the wave-number.
The laws of the spectrum are simpler when they are stated in terms of
wave-numbers than when they are stated in terms of wave-lengths. The
wave-number is also sometimes called the “frequency,” but this term is
more properly employed to express the number of waves that pass a given
place in a second. This is obtained by multiplying the wave-number by
the number of centimetres that light travels in a second, i.e. thirty
thousand million. These three terms, wave-length, wave-number, and
frequency must be borne in mind in reading spectroscopic work.</p>

<p>In stating the law’s which determine the spectrum of an element, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
shall for the present confine ourselves to hydrogen, because for all
other elements the laws are less simple.</p>

<p>For many years no progress was made towards finding any connection
between the different lines in the spectrum of hydrogen. It was
supposed that there must be one fundamental line, and that the others
must be like harmonies in music. The atom was supposed to be in a
state of complicated vibration, which sent out light-waves having the
same frequencies that it had itself. Along these lines, however, the
relations between the different lines remained quite undiscoverable.</p>

<p>At last, in 1908, a curious discovery was made by W. Ritz, which he
called the Principle of Combination. He found that all the lines were
connected with a certain number of inferred wave-numbers which are
called “terms,” in such a way that every line has a wave-number which
is the difference of two terms, and the difference between any two
terms (apart from certain easily explicable exceptions) gives a line.
The point of this law will become clearer by the help of an imaginary
analogy. Suppose a shop belonging to an eccentric shopkeeper had gone
bankrupt, and it was your business to look through the accounts.
Suppose you found that the only sums ever spent by customers in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
shop were the following: 19s:11d, 19s, 15s, 10s, 9s:11d, 9s, 5s,
4s:11d, 4s, 11d. At first these sums might seem to have no connection
with each other, but if it were worth your while you might presently
notice that they were the sums that would be spent by customers who
gave 20s, 10s, 5s, or 1s, and got 10s, 5s, 1s, or 1d. in change. You
would certainly think this very odd, but the oddity would be explained
if you found that the shopkeeper’s eccentricity took the form of
insisting upon giving one coin or note in change, no more and no less.
The sums spent in the shop correspond to the lines in the spectrum,
while the sums of 20s, 10s, 5s, 1s, and 1d. correspond to the terms.
You will observe that there are more lines than terms (10 lines and
5 terms, in our illustration). As the number of both increases, the
disproportion grows greater; 6 terms would give 15 lines, 7 terms would
give 21, 8 would give 28, 100 would give 4950. This shows that, the
more lines and terms there are, the more surprising it becomes that
the Principle of Combination should be true, and the less possible it
becomes to attribute its truth to chance. The number of lines in the
spectrum of hydrogen is very large.</p>

<p>The terms of the hydrogen spectrum can all be expressed very simply.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
There is a certain fundamental wave-number, called Rydberg’s constant
after its discoverer. Rydberg discovered that this constant was
always occurring in formulae for series of spectral lines, and it
has been found that it is very nearly the same for all elements. Its
value is about 109,700 waves per centimetre. This may be taken as the
fundamental term in the hydrogen spectrum. The others are obtained
from it by dividing it by 4 (twice two), 9 (three times three), 16
(four times four), and so on. This gives all the terms; the lines are
obtained by subtracting one term from another. Theoretically, this
rule gives an infinite number of terms, and therefore of lines; but in
practice the lines grow fainter as higher terms are involved, and also
so close together that they can no longer be distinguished. For this
reason, it is not necessary, in practice, to take account of more than
about 30 terms; and even this number is only necessary in the case of
certain nebulæ.</p>

<p>It will be seen that, by our rule, we obtain various series of terms.
The first series is obtained by subtracting from Rydberg’s constant
successively a quarter, a ninth, a sixteenth ... of itself, so that
the wave-numbers of its lines are respectively ¾, ⁸⁄₉, ¹⁵⁄₁₆ ... of
Rydberg’s constant. These wave-numbers correspond to lines in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
ultra-violet, which can be photographed but not seen; this series
of lines is called, after its discoverer, the Lyman series. Then there
is a series of lines obtained by subtracting from a quarter of Rydberg’s
constant successively a ninth, a sixteenth, a twenty-fifth ... of
Rydberg’s constant, so that the wave-numbers of this series are
⁵⁄₃₆, ³⁄₁₆, ²¹⁄₁₀₀ ... of Rydberg’s constant. This series of lines
is in the visible part of the spectrum; the formula for this series
was discovered as long ago as 1885 by Balmer. Then there is a series
obtained by taking a ninth of Rydberg’s constant, and subtracting
successively a sixteenth, twenty-fifth, etc. of Rydberg’s constant.
This series is not visible, because its wave-numbers are so small that
it is in the infra-red, but it was discovered by Paschen, after whom
it is called. Thus so far as the conditions of observation admit, we
may lay down this simple rule: the lines of the hydrogen spectrum are
obtained from Rydberg’s constant, by dividing it by any two square
numbers, and subtracting the smaller resulting number from the larger.
This gives the wave-number of some line in the hydrogen spectrum, if
observation of a line with that wave-number is possible, and if there
are not too many other lines in the immediate neighbourhood. (A square
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
number is a number multiplied by itself: one times one, twice two,
three times three, and so on; that is to say, the square numbers are 1,
4, 9, 16, 25, 36, etc.).</p>

<p>All this, so far, is purely empirical. Rydberg’s constant, and the
formulæ for the lines of the hydrogen spectrum, were discovered
merely by observation, and by hunting for some arithmetical formula
which would make it possible to collect the different lines under
some rule. For a long time the search failed because people employed
wave-lengths instead of wave-numbers; the formulæ are more complicated
in wave-lengths, and therefore more difficult to discover empirically.
Balmer, who discovered the formula for the visible lines in the
hydrogen spectrum, expressed it in wave-lengths. But when expressed in
this form it did not suggest Ritz’s Principle of Combination, which led
to the complete rule. Even after the rule was discovered, no one knew
why there was such a rule, or what was the reason for the appearance of
Rydberg’s constant. The explanation of the rule, and the connection of
Rydberg’s constant with other known physical constants, was effected by
Niels Bohr, whose theory will be explained in the next chapter.</p>

POSSIBLE STATES OF THE HYDROGEN ATOM</h2>
</div>


<p>IT was obvious from the first that, when light is sent out by a body,
this is due to something that goes on in the atom, but it used to be
thought that, when the light is steady, whatever it is that causes the
emission of light is going on all the time in all the atoms of the
substance from which the light comes. The discovery that the lines of
the spectrum are the differences between terms suggested to Bohr a
quite different hypothesis, which proved immensely fruitful. He adopted
the view that each of the terms corresponds to a stable condition of
the atom, and that light is emitted when the atom passes from one
stable state to another, and only then. The various lines of the
spectrum are due, in this theory, to the various possible transitions
between different stable states. Each of the lines is a statistical
phenomenon: a certain percentage of the atoms are making the transition
that gives rise to this line. Some of the lines in the spectrum
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
are very much brighter than others; these represent very common
transitions, while the faint lines represent very rare ones. On a given
occasion, some of the rarer possible transitions may not be occurring
at all; in that case, the lines corresponding to these transitions will
be wholly absent on this occasion.</p>

<p class="space-above2 space-below2">
According to Bohr, what happens when a hydrogen atom gives out light
is that its electron, which has hitherto been comparatively distant
from the nucleus, suddenly jumps into an orbit which is much nearer to
the nucleus. When this happens, the atom loses energy, but the energy
is not lost to the world: it spreads through the surrounding medium
in the shape of light-waves. When an atom absorbs light instead of
emitting it, the converse process happens: energy is transferred from
the surrounding medium to the atom, and takes the form of making the
electron jump to a larger orbit. This accounts for fluorescence—that
is to say, the subsequent emission, in certain cases, of light of
exactly the same frequency as that which has been absorbed. The
electron which has been moved to a larger orbit by outside forces
(namely by the light which has been absorbed) tends to return to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
smaller orbit when the outside forces are removed, and in doing so it
give rise to light exactly like that which was previously absorbed.</p>

<p>Let us first consider the results to which Bohr was led, and afterwards
the reasoning by which he was led to them. We will assume, to begin
with, that the electron in a hydrogen atom, in its steady states, goes
round the nucleus in a circle, and that the different steady states
only differ as regards the size of the circle. As a matter of fact,
the electron moves sometimes in a circle and sometimes in an ellipse;
but Sommerfeld, who showed how to calculate the elliptical orbits that
may occur, also showed that, so far as the spectrum is concerned, the
result is very nearly the same as if the orbit were always circular. We
may therefore begin with the simplest case without any fear of being
misled by it. The circles that are possible on Bohr’s theory are also
possible on the more general theory, but certain ellipses have to be
added to them as further possibilities.</p>

<p>According to Newtonian dynamics, the electron ought to be capable of
revolving in any circle which had the nucleus in the centre, or in any
ellipse which had the nucleus in a focus; the question what orbit it
would choose would depend only upon the velocity and direction of its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
motion at a given moment. Moreover, if outside influences increased
or diminished its energy, it ought to pass by continuous graduations
to a larger or smaller orbit, in which it would go on moving after
the outside influences were withdrawn. According to the theory of
electrodynamics, on the other hand, an atom left to itself ought
gradually to radiate its energy into the surrounding æther, with the
result that the electron would approach continually nearer and nearer
to the nucleus. Bohr’s theory differs from the traditional views on
all these points. He holds that, among all the circles that ought to
be possible on Newtonian principles, only a certain infinitesimal
selection are really possible. There is a smallest possible circle,
which has a radius of about half a hundredth millionth of a centimetre.
This is the commonest circle for the electron to choose. If it does
not move in this circle, it cannot move in a circle slightly larger,
but must hop at once to a circle with a radius four times as large.
If it wants to leave this circle for a larger one, it must hop to one
with a radius nine times as large as the original radius. In fact, the
only circles that are possible, in addition to the smallest circle, are
those that have radii 4, 9, 16, 25, 36 ... times as large. (This is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
the series of square numbers, the same series that came in finding a
formula for the hydrogen spectrum.) When we come to consider elliptical
orbits, we shall find that there is a similar selection of possible
ellipses from among all those that ought to be possible on Newtonian
principles.</p>

<p>The atom has least energy when the orbit is smallest; therefore the
electron cannot jump from a smaller to a larger orbit except under the
influence of outside forces. It may be attracted out of its course by
some passing positively electrified atom, or repelled out of its course
by a passing electron, or waved out of its course by light-waves. Such
occurrences as these, according to the theory, may make it jump from
one of the smaller possible circles to one of the larger ones. But
when it is moving in a larger circle it is not in such a stable state
as when it is in a smaller one, and it can jump back to a smaller
circle without outside influences. When it does this, it will emit
light, which will be one or other of the lines of the hydrogen spectrum
according to the particular jump that is made. When it jumps from the
circle of radius 4 to the smallest circle, it emits the line whose
wave-number is ¾ of Rydberg’s constant. The jump from radius 9 to the
smallest circle gives the line which is ⁸⁄₉ of Rydberg’s constant; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
jump from radius 9 to radius 4 gives the line which is ⁵⁄₃₆ (i.e. ¼ = ⅑)
of Rydberg’s constant, and so on. The reasons why this occurs will
be explained in the next chapter.</p>

<p>When an electron jumps from one orbit to another, this is supposed to
happen instantaneously, not merely in a very short time. It is supposed
that for a time it is moving in one orbit, and then instantaneously it
is moving in the other, without having passed over the intermediate
space. An electron is like a man who, when he is insulted, listens at
first apparently unmoved, and then suddenly hits out. The process by
which an electron passes from one orbit to another is at present quite
unintelligible, and to all appearance contrary to everything that has
hitherto been believed about the nature of physical occurrences.</p>

<p>This discontinuity in the motion of an electron is an instance of
a more general fact which has been discovered by the extraordinary
minuteness of which physical measurements have become capable. It used
always to be supposed that the energy in a body could be diminished
or increased continuously, but it now appears that it can only be
increased or diminished by jumps of a finite amount. This strange
discontinuity would be impossible if the changes in the atom were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
continuous; it is possible because the atom changes from one state
to another by revolution, not by evolution. Evolution in biology and
relativity in physics seemed to have established the continuity of
natural processes more firmly than ever before; Newton’s action at
a distance, which was always considered something of a scandal, was
explained away by Einstein’s theory of gravitation. But just when the
triumph of continuity seemed complete, and when Bergson’s philosophy
had enshrined it in popular thought, this inconvenient discovery about
energy came and upset everything. How far it may carry us no one can
yet tell. Perhaps we were not speaking correctly a moment ago when we
said that an electron passes from one orbit to another “without passing
over the intermediate space”; perhaps there is no intermediate space.
Perhaps it is merely habit and prejudice that makes us suppose space
to be continuous. Poincaré—not the Prime Minister, but his cousin the
mathematician, who was a great man—suggested that we should even have
to give up thinking of time as continuous, and that we should have
to think of a minute, for instance, as a finite number of jerks with
nothing between them. This is an uncomfortable idea, and perhaps things
are not so bad as that. Such speculations are for the future; as yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
we have not the materials for testing them. But the discontinuity in
the changes of the atom is much more than a bold speculation; it is a
theory borne out by an immense mass of empirical facts.</p>

<p>The relation of the new mechanics to the old is very peculiar. The
orbits of electrons, on the new theory, are <i>among</i> those that
are possible on the traditional view, but are only an infinitesimal
selection from among these. According to the Newtonian theory, an
electron ought to be able to move round the nucleus in a circle of
any radius, provided it moved with a suitable velocity; but according
to the new theory, the only circles in which it can move are those
we have already described: a certain minimum circle, and others with
radii 4, 9, 16, 25, 36 ... times as large as the radius of the minimum
circle. In view of this breach with the old ideas, it is odd that the
orbits of electrons, down to the smallest particulars, are such as
to be possible on Newtonian principles. Even the minute corrections
introduced by Einstein have been utilized by Sommerfeld to explain
some of the more delicate characteristics of the hydrogen spectrum. It
must be understood that, as regards our present question, Einstein and
the theory of relativity are the crown of the old dynamics, not the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
beginning of the new. Einstein’s work has immense philosophical and
theoretical importance, but the changes which it introduces in actual
physics are very small indeed until we come to deal with velocities
not much less than that of light. The new dynamics of the atom, on the
contrary, not merely alters our theories, but alters our view as to
what actually occurs, by leading to the conclusion that change is often
discontinuous, and that most of the motions which should be possible
are in fact impossible. This leaves us quite unable to account for the
fact that all the motions that are in fact possible are exactly in
accordance with the old principles, showing that the old principles,
though incomplete, must be true up to a point. Having discovered that
the old principles are not quite true, we are completely in the dark
as to why they have as much truth as they evidently have. No doubt the
solution of this puzzle will be found in time, but as yet there is not
the faintest hint as to how the reconciliation can be effected.</p>

<p>What is known about other elements than hydrogen by means of the
spectroscope all goes to show that the same principles apply, and that,
when light is emitted, an electron jumps from an outer orbit to an
inner one. But when there are many electrons revolving round a single
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
nucleus, the mathematics becomes too difficult for our present powers,
and it is impossible to establish such exact and striking coincidences
of theory and observation as in the case of hydrogen. Nevertheless,
what is known is sufficient to place it beyond reasonable doubt that
the explanation of the spectrum of other elements is the same in
principle as in the case of hydrogen. There is one case which can be
tested to the full, and that is the case of positively electrified
helium, which has lost one electron and has only one left. This only
differs from hydrogen (as regards the movements of the electron) by the
fact that the charge on the nucleus is twice as great as that on the
electron, instead of being equal to it, as with hydrogen, and that the
mass of the nucleus is four times that of the hydrogen nucleus. The
changes which this produces in the spectrum, as compared with hydrogen,
are exactly such as theory would predict.</p>

<p>In the present chapter, we have seen what was the conclusion to which
Bohr was led as to possible states of the hydrogen atom, but we have
not yet seen what was the reasoning by which he was led to this
conclusion. In order to understand this reasoning, it is necessary to
explain what is called the theory of quanta, of which Bohr’s theory of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
the atom is a special case. The theory of quanta will be the subject of
the next chapter.</p>

THE THEORY OF QUANTA</h2>
</div>


<p>THE theory that the energy of a body cannot vary continuously, but only
by a certain finite amount, or exact multiples of this amount, was not
originally derived from a study of the atom or the spectroscope, but
from the study of the radiation of heat. The theory was first suggested
by Planck in 1900, thirteen years before Bohr applied it to the atom.
Planck showed that it was necessary in order to account for the laws
of temperature radiation; roughly speaking, if bodies could part with
their warmth continuously, and not by jumps, they ought to grow colder
than they do, when they are not exposed to a source of heat. It would
take us too far from our subject to go into Planck’s reasoning, which
is somewhat abstruse. A good account of it in English will be found in
Jean’s <i>Report on Radiation and the Quantum-Theory</i>, published for
the Physical Society of London (1914).</p>

<p>Planck’s principle in its original form is as follows. If a body
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
is undergoing any kind of vibration or periodic motion of frequency
(i.e. the body goes through its whole period times in a second), then
there is a certain fundamental constant <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> such that the energy of
the body owing to this periodic motion is or some exact multiple of
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.525ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h \upsilon">.</span> That is to say, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.525ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h \upsilon"> is the smallest amount
of energy that can exist in any periodic process whose frequency is
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.222ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\upsilon">,</span> and if the energy is greater than <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.525ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h \upsilon"> it must
be exactly twice as great, or three times as great, or four times as
great, or etc. The energy was at first supposed to exist in atoms or
little indivisible parcels, each of amount <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.525ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h \upsilon">.</span> There might
be several parcels together, but there could never be a fraction of
a parcel. We shall see that this principle has been modified as it
has been applied in new fields, so that in its present form it can no
longer be stated as involving indivisible parcels of energy. But it is
as well to understand its original form before considering the more
recent statements of the principle.</p>

<p>The quantity <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h">,</span> which is called Planck’s “quantum,” is of course
very, very small, so small that in all the large-scale processes
observable by means of our senses there is an appearance of continuity.
It is in fact so small that one unit of it is involved in one
revolution of the electron in its minimum orbit round the hydrogen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
nucleus. It is difficult to express very large numbers in words,
particularly as the word “billion” is sometimes used to mean a thousand
million, and sometimes to mean a million million. If we use it to
mean a million million, we may say that a billion billion times <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h">
would be a quantity just appreciable without instruments of precision.
Taking the electron in its smallest orbit, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> is exactly obtained
by multiplying the circumference of the orbit by the velocity of the
electron and multiplying the result by the mass of the electron.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In
the second orbit the result of this multiplication is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.434ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/21.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2h">,</span> in the
third, <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.434ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="3h">,</span> and so on.</p>

<p>Planck’s principle in its original form applies only to certain kinds
of systems, and if rashly generalized it gives wrong results. The
right way to generalize it has been discovered by Sommerfeld, but
unfortunately it is very difficult to express in non-mathematical
language. It turns out that the principle, in its general form, cannot
be stated as involving little parcels of energy; this only seemed
possible because Planck was dealing with a special case. The general
form requires a method of stating the principles of dynamics which is
due to Hamilton. In this form, if the state of some material system
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
is determined at any moment when we know, at that moment, how large
certain quantities are (as for example the position of an aeroplane
is known if we know its latitude and longitude and its height above
the ground), then these quantities are called “coordinates” of the
system. Corresponding to each coordinate, the system has at each
moment a certain characteristic which may be called the corresponding
“impulse-coordinate.” In simple cases this reduces to what is
ordinarily called momentum; in a generalized sense, it may itself be
called the “momentum” corresponding to the coordinate in question. It
is possible to choose our coordinates in such a way that the momentum
corresponding to a given coordinate at a given moment shall not involve
any other coordinate. When the coordinates have been chosen in this
way, the generalized quantum principle is applicable. We shall assume
that such a choice has been made. When such a choice has been made, the
coordinates are said to be “separated.”</p>

<p>The quantum-principle is only applicable to motions that are periodic,
or what is called “conditionally periodic.” The motion of a system is
periodic if, after a certain lapse of time, its previous condition
recurs, and if this goes on and on happening after equal intervals
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
of time. The motion of a pendulum is periodic in this sense, because,
when it has had time to move from left to right and from right to left,
it is in the same position as before, and it goes on indefinitely
repeating the same motion. Wave-motions are periodic in the same sense;
so are the motions of the planets. Any motion is periodic if it can be
described by means of a quantity which increases up to a maximum, then
diminishes to a minimum, then increases to a maximum again, and so on,
always taking the same length of time from one maximum to the next. One
“period” of a periodic process is the time taken to complete the cycle
from one maximum to the next, or from one minimum to the next—for
example, from midnight to midnight, from New Year to New Year, from the
crest of one wave to the crest of the next, or from a moment when the
pendulum is at the extreme left of its beat to the next moment when it
is at the extreme left.</p>

<p>A system is called “conditionally periodic” when its motion is
compounded of a number of motions, each of which separately is
periodic, but which do not have the same period. For example, the earth
has a motion compounded of rotation round its axis, which takes a day,
and revolution round the sun, which takes a year. There are not an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
exact number of days in a year, if a year is taken in the astronomical
and not in the legal sense; that is why we need a complicated system
of leap-years to prevent errors from piling up. Thus when we take
account of both rotation and revolution, the motion of the earth is
“conditionally periodic.” We shall find later that the motions of
electrons in their orbits, when we take account of niceties, are,
strictly speaking, conditionally periodic and not simply periodic.
The quantum-theory in its general form applies to motions that are
conditionally periodic in terms of “separated” coordinates.</p>

<p>We can now state the generalized quantum-principle. Take some one
coordinate of the system, and imagine the motion of the system
throughout one period of this coordinate divided into a great number
of little bits. In each little bit, take the generalized momentum
corresponding to the coordinate in question, and multiply it by the
amount of change in the coordinate during that little bit. Add up all
these for all the little bits that make up one complete period. Then,
in the limit, when the bits are made very small and very numerous, the
result of the addition for one complete period will be exactly <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h">
or <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.434ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/21.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2h"> or <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.434ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="3h"> or some other exact multiple of <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h">.</span><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> No one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
knows in the least why this should be the case; all we can say is that
it is so, in all the cases that can be tested.</p>

<p>In later developments we shall have occasion to consider the principle
in its general form. For the present, we are only concerned with its
application to the electron revolving in a circle round the hydrogen
nucleus. In this case, the generalized momentum is the same thing
that is called “angular momentum” in elementary dynamics; in the case
of circular motion, which is the case that concerns us, it is got by
multiplying the mass by the radius and the velocity. As these are all
constant, there is no difficulty about obtaining the sum of little
bits for a complete cycle; each little bit consists of the angular
momentum multiplied by a little angle, and the sum of all the little
bits consists of the angular momentum multiplied by four right angles;
that is to say, it is obtained by multiplying the mass of the electron
by the circumference (instead of the radius) of its orbit and by the
velocity. By the generalized quantum-principle, this has to be <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> or
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.434ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/21.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2h"> or <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.434ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="3h"> or etc. In the minimum orbit it is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h">;</span> that is why
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
no smaller orbit is possible. In the next orbit, which is four times as
large, it is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.434ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/21.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2h">;</span> in the third orbit, which is nine times as large,
it is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.434ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="3h">;</span> and so on. In virtue of the quantum-principle, these are
the only orbits that are possible.</p>

<p>We can now understand how Bohr’s theory explains the lines of the
hydrogen spectrum. When the electron jumps from a larger to a smaller
orbit, it loses energy. A little very elementary mathematics<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> shows
that the kinetic energy in the second orbit is a quarter of that in the
first; in the third it is a ninth; in the fourth, a sixteenth; and so
on. It is also very easy to show that (apart from a constant portion
which may be ignored) the total energy in any orbit (potential and
kinetic together) is numerically equal to the kinetic energy, but with
the opposite sign. Therefore the loss of total energy in passing from
a larger to a smaller orbit is equal to the gain of kinetic energy.
It follows that, if we call <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.919ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\epsilon "> the kinetic energy in the
smallest orbit, the loss of energy in passing from the second orbit to
the smallest is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 3.045ex; height: 4.586ex;" src="images/24.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{3}{4} \epsilon">,</span> the loss in passing from
the third orbit to the first is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 3.045ex; height: 4.638ex;" src="images/25.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{8}{9} \epsilon">,</span> the loss in
passing from the third to the second is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 4.176ex; height: 4.638ex;" src="images/26.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{5}{36} \epsilon">,</span>
i.e. <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 11.268ex; height: 5.428ex;" src="images/27.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\left(\dfrac{1}{4} - \dfrac{1}{9}\right) \epsilon">;</span> and so on. It will
be noticed that the numbers that come here are the same as those that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
occurred in connection with Rydberg’s constant in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>The energy which is lost by the atom in one of these jumps is turned
into a light-wave. What sort of light-wave it is to become is
determined by the theory of quanta. A light-wave is a periodic process,
and if its frequency is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.222ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\upsilon">,</span> its period is a <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.921ex; height: 1.954ex;" src="images/28.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\upsilon^{\text{th}}">
of a second. The generalized quantum-principle shows that,
if the period of a wave is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/29.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t">,</span> the energy of the wave multiplied
by <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/29.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t"> must be <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> or an exact multiple of <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h">;</span> in fact, so
far as observation goes, it appears to be always <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h">.</span> Since <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/29.svg" alt=" " data-tex="t">
is a <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 2.921ex; height: 1.954ex;" src="images/30.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\upsilon ^{\text{th}}"> of a second (when <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.222ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\upsilon"> is the
frequency), it follows that the energy of the wave is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.525ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h \upsilon">.</span>
Also, by the principle of the conservation of energy, the energy of the
wave is equal to the energy that the atom has lost.</p>

<p>This shows that, if e is the kinetic energy of the electron in the
smallest orbit, the wave caused by a transition from the second orbit
to the first will have a frequency <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.222ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\upsilon"> given by the equation
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 8.587ex; height: 4.586ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{3}{4} \epsilon = h \upsilon
"></span>
For a transition from the third orbit to the first,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 8.587ex; height: 4.638ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{8}{9} \epsilon = h \upsilon
"></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
For a transition from the third orbit to the second,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 9.718ex; height: 4.638ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{5}{36} \epsilon = h \upsilon
"></span>
and so on. Comparing these results with the empirical results set forth
in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a>, we see that they will agree if Rydberg’s constant is
equal to <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.919ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/31.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\epsilon"> divided by <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> and the velocity of light. (We
have to divide by the velocity of light, because in this chapter we
have been speaking of frequencies, while in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a> we were speaking
of wave-numbers.) Now <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.919ex; height: 1ex;" src="images/31.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\epsilon"> is easily calculated since we know
the charge on a hydrogen nucleus and on an electron, the mass of an
electron, and the radius of the minimum orbit; also <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> and the
velocity of light are known. It is found that the calculated value of
Rydberg’s constant, from these data, agrees closely with the observed
value; this was, from the first, a powerful argument in favour of
Bohr’s theory.</p>

<p>For different kinds of light, the frequency <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.222ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\upsilon"> is different;
in the visible parts of the spectrum, it determines the colour, being
smallest for red and greatest for violet. By measuring the frequencies
of the different lines in the hydrogen spectrum, and multiplying each
by <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h">,</span> we find out how much energy the above loses in the different
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
transitions from orbit to orbit that are possible. The terms in the
spectrum are proportional to the energies in the different possible
orbits, and the frequencies of the lines are proportional to the loss
of energy in passing from one orbit to another. We can calculate what
the different possible orbits should be from the fact that their
energies must differ by an amount <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.525ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/32.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\upsilon h">,</span> where <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.222ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\upsilon">
is the frequency of some line in the hydrogen spectrum. We can also
calculate the possible orbits from the fact that the mass of the
electron multiplied by the circumference of an orbit multiplied by the
velocity in that orbit must be an exact multiple of <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h">.</span> These two
methods lead to the same result, and thus confirm our theory.</p>

<p>There are, however, certain <i>minutiæ</i> of the hydrogen spectrum
which cannot be explained by Bohr’s theory in its original form.
All these, down to the smallest particular, are explained by the
generalized form of the theory which is due in the main to Sommerfeld.
We shall explain this generalized theory in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The quantity <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h">,</span> Planck’s quantum, has been found to be involved in
all the very minute phenomena that can be adequately studied. It is one
of the fundamental constants to which science is led: for the present,
it represents a limit of explanations, since no one knows why there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
is such a constant or why it is just the size it is. The limits of our
explanations in any given stage of science are, while that stage lasts,
brute facts; and so Planck’s quantum, for the present, is a brute fact.
It is involved in all very small periodic processes; but why this
should be the case we do not know.</p>

REFINEMENTS OF THE HYDROGEN SPECTRUM</h2>
</div>


<p>IN Bohr’s theory, the electron always moves round the hydrogen nucleus
in a circle. But according to Newtonian principles, the electron
ought also to be able to move in an ellipse, and the generalized
quantum-principle can be applied to elliptic orbits as well as to those
that are circular. It is natural to inquire whether it is possible to
work out a theory that allows for elliptic orbits, and, if so, whether
it will fit the facts better or worse than Bohr’s original theory.
It is found that, as regards the broad facts, it makes no difference
whether we admit or reject elliptic orbits; in either case, the facts
will accord with observation to a first approximation. There are,
however, three delicate phenomena which are observed to occur, which
cannot be accounted for if all the possible orbits are circles, but are
to be expected if ellipses also occur. These are the following: First,
there is what is called the Zeeman effect, which is an alteration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
produced by a strong magnetic field. Secondly, there is the Stark
effect, which is produced by a strong electric field. Thirdly, there
is what is called the “fine structure,” which is the fact that each
single line of the spectrum, when very closely examined, is found to
consist of a number of almost identical lines. The explanation of the
Zeeman effect is still in part incomplete, but the explanation of the
other two by means of Sommerfeld’s methods is as perfect as could be
desired. We shall not attempt to set forth the explanation, which would
be impossible without a good deal of mathematics. We shall only attempt
to describe the orbits which Sommerfeld admits as possible, in addition
to Bohr’s circles.</p>

<p>If there is any reader who does not know what an ellipse looks like,
he can construct one for himself by the following simple device. Tie
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
a piece of string to two pins, and stick them into a piece of paper at
two points <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.459ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/34.svg" alt=" " data-tex="S">,</span> <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.459ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/34.svg" alt=" " data-tex="S">′ near enough together for the string to remain
loose. Then take a pencil, and with its point draw the string taut. Any
place <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/35.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P"> that the pencil will reach is on a certain ellipse, and by
moving the pencil round, the whole ellipse can be drawn. The points
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.459ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/34.svg" alt=" " data-tex="S">,</span> <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.459ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/34.svg" alt=" " data-tex="S">′ are called “foci.” An ellipse may be defined as a curve
such that, if <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/35.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/35.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">′ are any two points on it the sum of the
distance of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/35.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P"> from <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.459ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/34.svg" alt=" " data-tex="S"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.459ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/34.svg" alt=" " data-tex="S">′ (the foci) is equal to the sum
of the distances of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.699ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/35.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P">′ from <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.459ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/34.svg" alt=" " data-tex="S"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.459ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/34.svg" alt=" " data-tex="S">′. In our construction,
both are equal to the length of the string that we tied to the two
pins. The ratio of the distance between the pins to the length of the
string is called the “eccentricity” of the ellipse. It is obvious that
if we were to stick the two pins into the same place we should get a
circle, so that a circle is a particular case of an ellipse, namely an
ellipse which has zero eccentricity. All the planets move in ellipses
which are very nearly circles, whereas the comets move in ellipses
which are very far removed from circles. In each case the sun is in one
of the foci, and there is nothing particular in the other focus. An
ellipse which is very far from being a circle can be drawn by making
the distance <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 3.484ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/36.svg" alt=" " data-tex="S~S">′ between the two pins not very much shorter than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
the length of the string.</p>

  <img src="images/i002.jpg" width="300" height="250" alt="i002">

<p>There is another way of thinking of an ellipse which is also useful;
it may be thought of as a circle which has been squashed. Suppose for
instance that you took a wooden hoop and stood it up and put a weight
on the top of it; the hoop would get squashed into more or less the
shape of an ellipse. In the figure, the hoop is drawn circular, as
it is before the weight is put on; then a heavy weight is put on the

obtained from a circle which is standing upright by diminishing all

of “flattening” of the ellipse. This is not a recognized expression,
but will prove convenient for our purposes. To state the whole thing
precisely: Given a circle, imagine it to be stood upright, like a
wheel, with an axle through the centre. Then lower each point in the
top half of the wheel by a fixed proportion of its height above the
level of the axle, and raise each point in the bottom half in the same
proportion of the lowering to the final height (or of the raising
to the final depth, in the lower half) we will call the amount of
“flattening” in the ellipse. That is to say, if <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 3.98ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/46.svg" alt=" " data-tex="A~B"> is half of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 4.002ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/43.svg" alt=" " data-tex="B~C"> (and <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 4.054ex; height: 2.032ex;" src="images/45.svg" alt=" " data-tex="P~Q"> half of <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 4.733ex; height: 2.032ex;" src="images/42.svg" alt=" " data-tex="Q~M">)</span>, the amount of flattening is a

third; and so on.</p>

<p>We can now explain what are the ellipses which are possible for the
electron in a hydrogen atom.</p>

characteristics of the orbit, the general quantum-theory will give
two conditions that the orbit must fulfil, instead of only one. It is
impossible to explain the process by which the results are obtained,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
but the results themselves are fairly simple.</p>

<p>The first quantum condition is very much the same as in the case of
circular orbits. Take the mass of the electron, its velocity at <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 2.009ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/48.svg" alt=" " data-tex="N">
(where it is nearest to the nucleus <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.459ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/34.svg" alt=" " data-tex="S">)</span>, and the circumference of
the circle whose radius is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 4.034ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/52.svg" alt=" " data-tex="S~N">,</span> and multiply these three together;
the result must be an exact multiple of <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h">,</span> say <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.661ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/53.svg" alt=" " data-tex="nh">.</span> The second
quantum condition determines how much the ellipse departs from a
circle; it states that there is a second whole number <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/54.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> (the
second quantum number), such that <img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 2.975ex; height: 4.106ex;" src="images/55.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{n}{n′}"> is the amount of
flattening in the sense defined a moment ago. The second number <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/54.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n">′
may be zero; we then obtain Bohr’s case of circular orbits. If it is
not zero, the electron moves in a more or less eccentric orbit.</p>

<p>It turns out that, apart from niceties, the energy of an electron in
its orbit, and therefore the spectral lines corresponding to jumps
from one orbit to another, do not depend upon the separate numbers
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/54.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/54.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n">′, but only upon their sum <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.481ex; height: 1.505ex;" src="images/56.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n + n">'</span>. The result is
that the lines to be expected, apart from niceties, are the same as on
Bohr’s original theory of circular orbits. If the matter were to end
here, we might seem to have had a lot of trouble for nothing. Even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
then, however, we could have drawn a useful lesson from the theory of
elliptic orbits. There are, as we shall see, certain facts which are
explained by elliptic orbits and not by circular orbits, but these
facts are mostly recent discoveries, and might easily have remained
unknown for some time longer. In that case, Bohr’s original theory
would have accounted admirably for all the known facts, and there would
have seemed to be very strong grounds for accepting it. Yet the theory
of elliptic orbits would have accounted for the facts just as well,
so that there would have been no way of deciding between them. This
illustrates what is sometimes forgotten, that a theory which explains
all the known relevant facts down to the minutest particular may
nevertheless be wrong. There may be other theories, which no one has
yet thought of, which account equally well for all that is known. We
cannot accept a theory with any confidence merely because it explains
what is known. If we are to feel any security, we must be able to show
that no other theory would account for the facts. Sometimes this is
possible, but very often it is not. Poincaré advanced a proof that the
facts of temperature radiation cannot be explained if we assume that
radiation is a continuous process, and that any possible explanation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
must involve sudden jumps such as we have in the quantum theory. His
argument is difficult, and it is possible that it may not ultimately
prove wholly cogent. But it affords an instance of that further step
without which scientific hypothesis must remain hypothetical. In our
case, fortunately, there is evidence that elliptic orbits actually do
occur when an electron moves round a hydrogen nucleus. That is to say,
there is evidence that this hypothesis explains certain facts which
the hypothesis of circular orbits cannot explain. But although the
agreement between theory and observation is astonishingly close, it
cannot be said that we have yet reached the stage where we can be quite
certain that no other theory would account for the facts.</p>

<p>All the broad facts in the spectrum depend upon the sum of the two
quantum-numbers, <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.103ex; height: 1.505ex;" src="images/57.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n + n′">,</span> not on either separately. We therefore
classify orbits by this sum. We thus arrive at the following possible
orbits:</p>

<p>1st case. <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 10.251ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n + n′= 1">.</span> Since <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/54.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> cannot be zero (because if it
were the electron would fall into the nucleus), this gives only one
possibility, namely <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.506ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/59.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n = 1">,</span> <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.128ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/60.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n′ = 0">.</span> When <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.128ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/60.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n′ = 0">,</span> there is
no flattening, and the orbit is a circle. Thus this first case is that
of Bohr’s minimum circle.</p>

<p>2nd case. <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 10.251ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/61.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n + n′ = 2">.</span> Here there are two possibilities, namely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.506ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/62.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n = 2">,</span> <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.128ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/60.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n′ = 0"> and <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.506ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/59.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n = 1">,</span> <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.128ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/63.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n′ = 1"> The first of these
gives Bohr’s second circle; the second gives an ellipse in which there
is a unit amount of flattening, that is to say, the ellipse is half as
high as it is broad.</p>

<p>3rd case. <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 10.251ex; height: 1.69ex;" src="images/64.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n + n′ = 3">.</span> Here there are three possibilities, namely:
(a) <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.506ex; height: 1.69ex;" src="images/65.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n = 3">,</span> <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.128ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/60.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n′ = 0">;</span> this gives Bohr’s third circle (b) <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.506ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/62.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n = 2">,</span>
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.128ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/63.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n′ = 1">;</span> this gives an ellipse in which the amount of
flattening is a half, that is to say, the ellipse is two-thirds as high
as it is broad, (c) <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 5.506ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/59.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n = 1">,</span> <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.128ex; height: 1.692ex;" src="images/66.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n′ = 2">;</span> this gives an ellipse in
which the amount of flattening is two, that is to say, the ellipse is a
third as high as it is broad.</p>

<p>In the fourth case, <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 10.251ex; height: 1.717ex;" src="images/67.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n + n′= 4">,</span> there are four possibilities; and so
on. The breadth of the ellipse depends only upon <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.103ex; height: 1.505ex;" src="images/57.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n + n′">,</span> so that
all the possible ellipses under one head have the same breadth. The
energy also, apart from niceties, depends only upon <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.103ex; height: 1.505ex;" src="images/57.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n + n′">.</span><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Of the three sets of facts which show that elliptical orbits must
occur, we shall pass by the Zeeman effect (which shows how magnetism
splits one line into three, or sometimes more) and the Stark effect
(which shows the influence of an electric field). The third, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
is so interesting that it cannot be omitted, since it shows that the
electron, in so far as it obeys ordinary dynamical laws, follows the
principles of Einstein in preference to those of Newton.</p>

<p>Very careful observation shows that the lines in the spectrum which we
have hitherto treated as single really consist of two (and in other
cases three or more) separate lines very close together. This suggests
that two different orbits which give the same value of <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.103ex; height: 1.505ex;" src="images/57.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n + n′">
do not produce <i>exactly</i> the same line in the spectrum when an
electron jumps to or from them. The phenomenon is more noticeable in
the case of other elements than in that of hydrogen, for reasons which
the theory explains. Fortunately on this point our theory is able to
tell us a good deal about other atoms; but in what follows we shall
confine ourselves to hydrogen.</p>

<p>The mathematical argument which shows that the energy of the electron
in its orbit only depends upon <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.103ex; height: 1.505ex;" src="images/57.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n + n′"> proceeds on Newtonian
principles; more particularly, it treats the mass of the electron as
constant. But in the modern theory of relativity, the mass of a body is
increased by rapid motion. This increase is not noticeable for ordinary
velocities, but becomes very great as we approach the velocity of
light, which is a limit that no material body can quite reach. Readers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
may remember that Einstein’s theory of gravitation has been confirmed
by two facts which remained inexplicable on Newtonian principles. One
is the fact that light bends by a certain amount (double what Newtonian
principles allow) when it passes near the sun, which has been verified
in two eclipses. The other is the fact which is called the motion of
the perihelion of Mercury, which had long been known to astronomers
without their being able to find any way of accounting for it. It is
the analogue of this fact that concerns us. Mercury, like the other
planets, moves in an ellipse with the sun in a focus; it is sometimes
nearer to the sun and sometimes further from it. Its “perihelion”
is the point of its orbit which is nearest to the sun. Now it has
been found by observation that, when Mercury has gone once round the
sun from its previous perihelion, it has not quite reached its next
perihelion; that is to say, it has to go a little more than once round
the sun in passing from one occasion when it is nearest the sun to the
next. This of course shows that its orbit is not quite accurately an
ellipse. There is supposed to be a similar phenomenon in the motions of
the other planets, but it is too small to be observed; in the case of
Mercury it is just large enough to be noticeable. Einstein’s theory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
of gravitation, but not Newton’s, explains why it exists, and why it
is just as large as it is; it also explains why the effect in the
case of the other planets is too small to be observed. In order to be
noticeable, the orbit must depart fairly widely from a circle, but the
orbits of all the planets except Mercury are very nearly circular.</p>

<p>In the case of the electron in the hydrogen atom, as we have seen the
possible orbits which are not circles are very markedly elliptical.
This makes the effect which has been noticed in the case of Mercury
very much more pronounced in the case of the electron. Moreover, since
the velocity of the electron in its orbit is much greater than that of
the planets, there is a much more noticeable effect of the increased
velocity, when the electron is near the nucleus, in increasing the
mass. This causes a quite appreciable effect of the same sort as the
motion of the perihelion of Mercury. That is to say, the electron makes
a little more than one complete revolution between one occasion when
it is nearest to the nucleus and the next occasion when this happens.
It is found that this accounts for the fine structure of the spectral
lines, though it would be impossible to set forth the explanation in
non-mathematical language. It is curious that, although the quantum
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
theory is something quite outside traditional dynamics, everything
unaffected by this theory proceeds exactly according to the very best
principles of non-quantum dynamics, that is to say, according to
Einstein rather than Newton. The proof is in this fact of the fine
structure.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

the motion of the perihelion in the above is not, properly speaking,
the same as in the case of Mercury; the latter depends upon the general
theory of relativity, and Einstein’s new law of gravitation, while the
former depends only upon the special theory of relativity.</p>

RINGS OF ELECTRONS</h2>
</div>


<p>WHEN we come to atoms that have more than one electron, we can no
longer work out the mathematics in the same complete way as we can in
the case of hydrogen and positively electrified helium. We shall see in
the next chapter, however, that X-ray spectra (which are a very modern
discovery) tell us a great deal about the inner rings of electrons in
complex atoms, while optical spectra continue to tell us a good deal
about the outer ring. As we travel up the periodic table, the first
element in each period, which is an alkali, has only one electron in
the outermost ring; accordingly we might expect this one electron to
move more or less as the hydrogen electron does, since the positive
charge on the nucleus exceeds the negative charges on the inner
electrons by just the amount of the charge on an electron or a hydrogen
nucleus, and the inner electrons may be expected to be never very near
the outer electron, as distances go within an atom. This would lead
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
us to look out for a spectrum, in the case of an alkali, more or less
similar to that of hydrogen; and in fact, this is found to be the case.
Some inferences can be drawn from the fact that in all series spectra
Rydberg’s constant makes its appearance. There can be no doubt that the
quantum theory applies, and that the orbit of an electron (as in the
case of elliptical orbits in hydrogen) is in general determined by two
quantum numbers, both of them whole numbers which are usually small.</p>

<p>There is, however, considerable uncertainty about the arrangement of
the electrons when there are more than one.</p>

<p>Already with helium, which has only two electrons, complications arise.
There are two complete systems in the helium spectrum, each such as one
might expect to constitute the whole spectrum of an element. This leads
Bohr to the conclusion that there are two possibilities for the stable
state of the second electron, in one of which it moves in an orbit
similar to that of the first, while in the other it moves in an orbit
considerably larger than that of the first. These two states would
not be related as are the different possible orbits in the hydrogen
atom; that is to say, an electron left to itself would never jump from
the larger to the smaller orbit. They are both final states, after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
all jumps have been made. The atom cannot pass from one to the other
directly, but only by a roundabout process. When both electrons move in
similar minimum orbits, they cannot be in the same plane. Originally
it was assumed, merely in order to try simple hypothesis first, that
the electrons in an atom all moved in the same plane. This hypothesis
has had to be abandoned, and it is now believed that even the electrons
constituting one ring are in different planes. In fact it is suggested
that, in an inert gas, the eight electrons constituting the outer
ring are arranged more or less like the eight corners of a cube. But
according to Bohr even this hypothesis is still too simple.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that, when we were dealing with elliptic orbits
in the hydrogen atom, we found that the two quantum members <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/54.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.98ex; height: 1.292ex;" src="images/68.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n′"> were not individually so important as their sum, <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 6.103ex; height: 1.505ex;" src="images/57.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n + n′">.</span> We
call this the “total quantum number.” Although we cannot calculate in
detail the paths of electrons in other atoms, we can see that there
will still be a “total quantum number,” the sum of two partial quantum
numbers, which will determine the most important features of the
orbit. Rings of electrons will be sets having the same total quantum
number. If their two partial quantum numbers severally are the same,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
their orbits will have the same shape; if not, the orbits of some
will be much more eccentric than those of others. It may happen that
the orbit of an electron belonging to an outer ring is so eccentric
that at moments it penetrates within an inner ring, just as a comet
which is usually very distant from the sun may for a short time be
nearer than any of the planets. When an electron penetrates in this
way into regions thoroughly settled by other electrons, all of which
are repelled by it, the effect must be very disturbing. Comets produce
no great disturbance in the solar system, because their mass is very
small; but electrons are all equal, not only as to their mass, which is
less important, but as to their electric charge, which is what governs
their motions. It seems as if an atom must be somewhat uncomfortable,
and have anything but a harmonious family life, if it is subject to
such irruptions several billions of times in every second. However,
apparently it gets used to them, and learns to adjust itself.</p>

<p>The phenomena of the optical spectrum are produced by disturbances in
the outer ring of electrons, i.e. when one of the outer electrons has
been moving in an orbit which is larger than the normal orbit of an
electron in the outer ring, and suddenly jumps to this normal orbit
or to some intermediate one. But X-rays arise from disturbances in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
the inner rings of electrons. If an electron is torn away from the
inner regions of an atom, it will soon be replaced by some electron
which was formerly in the outer ring; there is a vacant place near the
nucleus, and any electron that can will seize the chance to occupy it.
The amount of energy radiated out in waves when this occurs is very
great, and therefore the frequency of the waves is very great. X-rays
only differ from ordinary light-waves by their great frequency, so
that the emission of X-rays is just what might be expected under such
circumstances. This is why X-rays give us so much information about the
inner rings.</p>

<p>Bohr<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> has given a table setting out his theory of the way the
electrons are arranged in the various inert gases, each of which has
its outer ring as full as it will hold until there are other electrons
outside it. The helium atom, in its commoner form, he supposes to
contain two electrons moving in circles, each with the same total
quantum number, namely 1, as the minimum circle in hydrogen.
There is, however, as we saw, another form of helium, in which one
of the electrons moves in an eccentric orbit. In the next inert gas,
neon, there are 10 electrons, two in the inner ring and eight in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
the outer. The two in the inner ring, according to his table, remain
as in helium, but of the outer eight four are moving in circles and
four in ellipses. This and the other figures in his table apply, of
course, to the atom in its most compressed state, the state to which
it tends when it is let alone, the state corresponding to the minimum
circle in hydrogen. Argon, which comes next with 18 electrons, has
its two inner rings as in neon, but has eight electrons in a third
ring. Partly from spectroscopic considerations, partly on grounds of
stability, Bohr maintains that these eight outer electrons none of
them move in circles, but are divided into two groups of four, the
first group moving in orbits of very great eccentricity, the second
in less eccentric orbits. The first group of four will, at moments
penetrate inside the first ring. It is assumed that the two inner rings
are definitely completed as soon as we reach neon, but that the later
rings are not completed so quickly. For reasons which we explained
in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III</a>, the periods containing a great many elements in the
periodic table are best explained by assuming that the change from
one element to the next is not always in the outermost ring, but is
sometimes in the next ring, or even (in the case of the rare earths) in
the next but one. According to these principles, krypton, which is the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 3.962ex; height: 2.049ex;" src="images/69.svg" alt=" " data-tex="36^{\text{th}}"> element, and so has 18 more electrons than argon,
is not to have the whole 18 in its outer ring. Only 8 are to be
in the outer ring; the remaining 10 are added to the third ring,
which is to have eighteen electrons, six in orbits like one previous
group of four, six in orbits like the other previous group of four,
and six in circles. The eight outer electrons are again divided into
two groups of four, one group exceedingly eccentric (more so than any
in argon), and the other group somewhat less so. Passing to xenon, the
<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 3.962ex; height: 2.074ex;" src="images/70.svg" alt=" " data-tex="54^{\text{th}}"> element in the periodic table, the first three rings
are as in krypton, the fourth ring has 18 electrons instead of
8, six in each of the groups that previously had four, and six in
orbits that are not circles, but have only a small eccentricity. As we
saw in connection with hydrogen in the <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">previous chapter</a>, as the total
quantum number increases, the number of possible orbits increases.
When the total quantum number is one, there is only one possibility
(a circle); when 2, there are two; when 3, there are three,
and so on. This does not mean that there can be only one orbit whose
total quantum number is one; it only means that any orbit whose total
quantum number is one must be a circle of a certain size. There may
be (except in hydrogen there are) two electrons moving in circles of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
this size, but in different planes. Similarly in the other cases. As we
travel up the series of total quantum numbers, more and more eccentric
orbits become possible; circles always remain possible, but the number
of possible types of ellipses increases by one at each step. When the
total quantum number is three (third ring), the ratio of the breadth to
the height may be 3 or 2 or 1. (The ratio 1 corresponds
to a circle.) When it is four (fourth ring), the ratio may be 4
or 3 or 2 or 1; and so on. When the breadth is very much
greater than the height, the orbit is very eccentric. Bohr holds that
in each ring the more eccentric orbits are filled first, and the less
eccentric later; he bases this view on considerations of stability,
because we always have to account for the fact that the system of
electrons does not break down more often than it does.</p>

<p>In accordance with this principle, the outer (fifth) ring in xenon
is to have eight electrons divided into two groups of four, the
first group having the most eccentric orbits possible at this stage
(length five times the breadth), the second group having the next most
eccentric orbits (length five times half the breadth). For convenience,
we are speaking as if the orbits of the electrons were still ellipses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
and circles, but of course this is only very roughly true when we have
to deal with a crowd of electrons which all have to dodge each other.
It is only true to the same degree that a person walking along Oxford
Street in the afternoon walks in a straight line; a straight line gives
the general direction of his movement, but he is always deviating from
it to get out of people’s way. Similarly the electrons, when they come
close together, repel each other violently, and shove each other out of
the smooth circular or elliptical course. But for general descriptive
purposes it is convenient to ignore this. What we can hope to find out
about the electrons is the quantum-numbers of their orbits, because
these determine the spectral lines. But we cannot hope with our present
mathematical knowledge to calculate exactly the orbit of an electron
with two given quantum numbers, although we can see in a general way
what sort of orbit it must be. This is to be borne in mind when, for
brevity, we speak of ellipses and circles in connection with atoms that
have a great many electrons.</p>

<p>Between xenon and niton comes the period of 32 elements, so that
in constructing a model of the niton atom in its normal state we
have to find room for 32 new electrons. This is done as follows:
the first three rings remain unchanged; the fourth is augmented to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
contain 32 electrons, 8) in each group that previously held
6, and 8 in circular orbits; the fifth ring is increased from
8 electrons to 18, of which there are 6 in each group that
previously held 4, and 6 in a new group of slightly eccentric
orbits; the sixth ring contains 8 electrons, four moving in very
eccentric orbits (length six times breadth), the other four in less
eccentric orbits (length three times breadth). It would of course be
possible to go on constructing models of atoms with larger numbers of
electrons, but after niton only six more elements are known, and they
are breaking down through radio-activity. It seems therefore that the
series stops where it does because heavier atoms would not be stable.
However, since new elements are discovered from time to time, we cannot
be sure that no element heavier than uranium will ever be discovered.
It would therefore be rash to get to work to prove that such elements
are impossible.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the above models of complicated atoms
have the same degree of certainty as the theory of the hydrogen atom.
They are as yet in part speculative. But it is in the highest degree
probable that the models give a more or less correct general picture
of the way the electrons behave when the atoms in question are in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
their most stable state. The emission of light and X-rays occurs when
one electron makes a transition towards the most stable configuration,
which is the one intended to be described by the models we have been
considering. Absorption, on the contrary, takes place when there is a
transition away from the most stable configuration under the influence
of outside forces.</p>

X-RAYS</h2>
</div>


<p>EVERYBODY knows something about X-rays, because of their use in
medicine. Everybody knows that they can take a photograph of the
skeleton of a living person, and show the exact position of a bullet
lodged in the brain. But not everybody knows why this is so. The reason
is that the capacity of ordinary matter for stopping the rays varies
approximately as the fourth power of the atomic number of the elements
concerned. Thus carbon, whose atomic number is 6, is 1296
times as effective as hydrogen in stopping X-rays; oxygen, whose
atomic number is 8, is 4096 times as effective as hydrogen;
nitrogen, whose atomic number is 7, is 2401 times as effective
as hydrogen; calcium, whose atomic number is 20, is 160,000
as effective as hydrogen. The human body consists mainly of carbon,
oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen, but the bones consist mainly of calcium.
Consequently X-rays which go through the rest of the body easily are
stopped by the bones with the result that we get a photograph of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
skeleton. Lead, of which the atomic number is 82, is about 45 million
times as effective as hydrogen and about 280 times as effective as
calcium; so it no wonder that bullets come out clearly in X-ray
photographs.</p>

<p>In this chapter we shall be concerned with the physical nature of
X-rays, not with their application to medicine.</p>

<p>When swiftly moving electrons strike ordinary matter, which happens in
the case of so-called “cathode-rays” and “<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-rays,” they give
rise to X-rays, which were discovered by Roentgen in 1895. It was not
known until 10 years later whether these rays were longitudinal or
transverse; then Barkla showed that they are transverse, like light,
and it is now known that they only differ from light by their very much
greater frequency. When a body is hit by X-rays, it gives out X-rays
itself, which are called “secondary X-rays.” These in turn give rise
to “tertiary X-rays.” The X-rays emitted by a body are of two sorts,
partly mixed and having no particular relation to the body which emits
them, partly characteristic of the body. It is only the latter that
can be said to have a spectrum belonging to the substance of which the
body is composed. The characteristic X-rays emitted by an element,
when analyzed, are found to consist of only a few sharp lines,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
giving a very simple spectrum, which varies in a perfectly regular
manner with the atomic number. Unlike the optical spectra, the X-ray
spectra of different elements are closely similar, with an increase
of frequency in corresponding lines as the atomic number increases.
Broadly speaking, there are three lines the K, L, and M lines as they
are called, which make up the X-ray spectra; but technical difficulties
make it impossible to observe more than two in one element. None can
be observed in very light elements; the K-line cannot be observed
in very heavy elements, and the M-line can only be observed in very
heavy elements. But this is fully accounted for by the difficulties of
observation. X-ray spectra can only be observed by means of suitable
crystals, and the observations are limited by the crystals that
are available. There is every reason to believe that, if we could
invent suitable apparatus, we should find that all three lines exist
throughout the series of elements. They are, in fact, roughly the same
as the principal lines in the hydrogen spectrum, which in that case
fall in the optical region. The frequency of each line increases very
nearly as the square of the atomic number, as we pass from one element
to another. Each line corresponds to a transition from one ring of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
electrons to another.</p>

<p>What may be supposed to happen when X-rays are excited is closely
similar to what happens when visible rays are excited. An electron,
passing in the cathode stream (which consists of swiftly moving
electrons), penetrates into the inner rings of electrons, and manages
to knock out one of the electrons in an inner ring. The resulting
state of affairs is unstable, and presently the outer rings supply an
electron to the vacant place in the inner ring. The result is that the
atom loses energy, which spreads out in a wave just like a light-wave.
But when heavy atoms are concerned, the great charge on the nucleus
causes the time of revolution of the nearer electrons to be much
less than in the case of hydrogen. Roughly speaking, the number of
revolutions per second in an orbit having given quantum numbers will
increase as the square of the atomic number of the element concerned.
It follows that this applies also to the difference of energy between
two different rings, and therefore (by Planck’s principle) to the
frequency of the corresponding spectral line; for, by Planck’s
principle, when an electron jumps from one ring to another, the
frequency of the corresponding spectral line is obtained by dividing
the loss of energy by <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h">.</span> Thus roughly speaking we should expect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
X-ray spectra to give the same lines for different elements, only with
frequencies that increase as the square of the atomic number; and in
fact this is what we do find. It is because the frequency increases
so fast as we go up the periodic table that the inner rings of the
later elements give lines in the X-ray spectrum instead of the optical
spectrum.</p>

<p>X-ray spectra do not occur, as a regular thing, in the form of
absorption spectra, and in this they differ from optical spectra. It
is worth while to understand why this is. When ordinary light of a
frequency which an element is capable of emitting, passes through a gas
composed of the element, the element absorbs all or some of it, though
light of other frequencies passes through freely. The reason is that
light corresponding to a spectral line of the element supplies just the
quantum required to move an electron from an inner to an outer ring.
The energy of the light-wave is used up in doing this. The electrons
involved in optical spectra are only those in the outer ring; in a
case of absorption, they are moved still further out into an empty
region, from which they may return at some later time in a case of
fluorescence. But in X-ray spectra the electrons concerned are those
in the inner rings. When one of these is fetched out by a passing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
electron, it cannot settle in an outer ring, because the outer rings
are already occupied by electrons. Each of the electrons that it passes
on the way out repels it, and gives it (so to speak) an extra shove.
The result is that it cannot rest in an outer ring, unless by some
exceptional stroke of luck, but has to go wandering off into space. The
energy involved in such a journey is not tied down to certain amounts,
like the energy involved in passing from one possible orbit to another.
Its place in the inside is taken by one of the outer electrons, while
the outer ring remains one electron short until it has a chance to help
itself from some other atom or by means of some free electron.</p>

<p>We saw in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II</a> that what is called the atomic number of an
element is more important than the atomic weight. The atomic number
represents a fundamental property of the atom, namely the positive
charge on the nucleus; an atom with such-and-such an atomic number
has a charge on the nucleus which is such-and-such a number of times
the charge on the hydrogen nucleus, or the opposite charge on the
electron. It follows that an atom in its neutral state, i.e. when it
is unelectrified, has a number of electrons round the nucleus which
is the same as its atomic number. But atomic weight had the prestige
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
of tradition as the characteristic by which atoms should be arranged
in a series, and the few cases (four in all) where the periodic table
inverts the order of atomic weights were felt to be annoying. X-ray
spectra, however, have given a decisive victory to the classification
by atomic numbers. We saw that different elements have very similar
X-ray spectra, except that the frequencies of corresponding lines
increase as the square of the atomic number (approximately) as we pass
from element to element. This law is fulfilled just as exactly in cases
in which the atomic weight would invert the order as it is in other
cases. This is what theory would lead us to expect, if each step up the
periodic series makes an increase of one in the positive charge on the
nucleus; and on any other hypothesis it seems scarcely possible. The
X-ray spectra, therefore, afford a very powerful argument in favour
of Rutherford’s general conception of the way atoms are constructed,
as well as in favour of the theory of quanta as the explanation of
spectral lines.</p>

<p>The law of X-ray spectra is the same as the law of optical spectra,
namely that, if <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.222ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\upsilon"> is the frequency of a line in the spectrum
(i.e. the number of waves per second), and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> is Planck’s quantum,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> multiplied by <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.222ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\upsilon"> is the energy lost by the atom in
the transition which gives rise to the line in question. There are
three principal lines in X-ray spectra, called, respectively, the
K, L, and M lines. For any given atom, the K line has the greatest
frequency and the M line the least. The K line represents a transition
by an outer electron to the inmost ring, the L line represents a
transition to the second ring, and the M line to the third. Each line,
closely examined, is found not to be single, but to consist of several
neighbouring lines corresponding to different starting-points for the
electron, but all having the same end-point. Since we can observe the
frequencies of the different lines, we can infer from the X-ray spectra
what are the differences between energies of electrons in different
rings. Everything confirms the theory of the structure of atoms which
was suggested by the hydrogen spectrum and the facts upon which the
periodic table is based.</p>

<p>Another very instructive fact which emerges from the study of X-ray
spectra concerns the “fine structure,” of which, as we saw in Chapter
VII, the explanation is to be sought in the substitution of Einstein’s
principles for Newton’s. In the case of hydrogen, the different lines
of the five structures are so near together that accurate measurements
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
of their distance apart are very difficult. But the distance between
them, as we pass to later elements, ought to increase roughly as the
fourth power of the atomic number, so that measurements become much
easier for high atomic numbers. On this point, the empirical evidence
obtained from X-ray spectra agrees closely with the theory developed by
Sommerfeld. This theory depended, it will be remembered, on the fact
that, according to the doctrine of relativity, an electron which moves
in an eccentric orbit has to go rather more than once round its orbit
before getting back to the point at which it is nearest to the nucleus.
The X-ray observations establish this theory much more firmly than is
possible by the help of optical spectra alone.</p>

<p>It must be understood that, so far as quantum numbers are concerned,
the actual orbits of electrons in atoms that have many rings are the
same as the possible orbits of the one electron in the hydrogen atom.
The partial dimensions are not the same; the radius of the minimum
circle, roughly speaking, varies inversely as the atomic number,
so that in uranium it might be expected to be about 92 times
smaller than in hydrogen. The velocity of the inside electron in its
minimum orbit varies roughly as the atomic number, and the number of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
revolutions per second roughly as the square of the atomic number. But
the radius multiplied by the velocity is independent of the atomic
number. To a first approximation, the mass of the electron multiplied
by its velocity multiplied by the circumference of its orbit (when it
moves in a circle) will always be <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> in the inmost ring, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.434ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/21.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2h"> in
the second, <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 2.434ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="3h"> in the third, and so on. The important thing to know
about an orbit is what are its quantum numbers, i.e. what multiples of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> are involved. This is just as true in regard to X-ray spectra as
in regard to optical spectra.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the electron in a hydrogen atom has, in a certain
sense, more freedom than one of the many electrons in heavier atoms.
There is less overcrowding and more room for migration. Under the
influence of incident light, the hydrogen electron can move out to a
larger orbit; presently, when the light is gone, it can return again.
But an electron in one of the inner rings of a heavy atom cannot remove
at will to another orbit. If it is forced to leave its orbit, it has
to leave the atom altogether. The other paths which the quantum-theory
permits are occupied, until we get to a considerable distance from the
nucleus, whereas in hydrogen they are vacant. Paths that have large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
quantum numbers, though possible in theory, cannot occur in practice,
at any rate in the laboratory, because they are so large that they
would cause the electron to get into the region of other atoms. In
certain nebulæ, where matter is almost inconceivably tenuous, the
spectrum shows that electrons can travel round hydrogen nuclei in
orbits whose total quantum number is as large as 30. But even in
the nearest approach to a vacuum that we can create artificially there
are still too many atoms for such large orbits to be possible. That
is why there is a limit, in practice, to the number of lines in the
spectrum of an element, although, in theory, the number of possible
lines is infinite.</p>

RADIO-ACTIVITY</h2>
</div>


<p>SHORTLY after the discovery of X-rays, the world was startled by the
discovery of radio-activity. The discoverer was the French physicist
Becquerel. What first led him into the discovery was the fact that
a very sensitive photographic plate was put away in a dark cupboard
with a piece of uranium, and was found afterwards to have photographed
the uranium in spite of the complete darkness. On investigating this
remarkable phenomenon, Becquerel found that the rays which produced
the photograph came from the uranium itself, and did not depend upon
any previous exposure to light, as is the case with fluorescent
substances. Uranium was found to be able to produce rays out of itself
apparently indefinitely, and these rays were very powerful. At first
the discovery was upsetting. It seemed to go against the conservation
of energy, because the energy radiated by the uranium was to all
appearances created out of nothing. This turned out not to be the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
case; the energy, as we shall see, comes out of the nucleus of the
uranium atom. But something equally astonishing was found to happen:
in radio-activity one element turns into another. Throughout the
middle ages, chemists had tried in vain to transmute elements; the
impossibility of doing so seemed to be one of the most certain results
of chemistry. This has proved to be a mistake; in radio-activity atoms
of one element throw out particles from the nucleus and become atoms of
another element.</p>

<p>Radio-activity is associated in popular thought with radium, but in
fact the discovery of radium was caused by that of radio-activity,
not vice versa. Monsieur and Madame Curie, who were working under
Becquerel, observed that pitchblende, from which uranium is obtained,
is more radio-active than pure uranium. They inferred that it must
contain some very radio-active constituent, much more active than
uranium. The search finally led Madame Curie to the new element radium.
Since then, a number of new radio-active elements have been discovered.
Sommerfeld (<i>op. cit</i>. p. 56) enumerates forty of them, and there
is no reason to suppose the list complete.</p>

<p>Before going into the process by which a radio-active atom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
disintegrates, let us consider the rate at which different radio-active
substances decay. The atoms of radio-active substances are like a
population which has a certain death-rate; in a given time, a given
percentage of them die, and are born again as atoms of a different
substance. But they are not endowed, like human beings, with a certain
span of life. Some live a very short time, and some a very long time;
the old ones are no more liable to death than the young ones. So far as
we can tell, any population of atoms of a given radio-active element
will lose a certain proportion in a given time, quite regardless of
the question whether the atoms are old or young. It is customary to
measure the rapidity of disintegration by the length of time that it
takes for half of a given collection of atoms to die. This period
varies enormously from one substance to another. Uranium, which is
only very slightly radio-active, takes 4500 million years, in its
most stable form, for half its atoms to decay. The first product of
their disintegration is a substance of which half decays in just
under 24 days; this breaks down into a substance for which the
period is less than a minute and a quarter; the next substance has
an uncertain period, estimated at two million years; at this stage,
two different products may be formed, one of which in turn becomes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
radium, of which the period is 1580 years, while the other becomes
protactinium, of which the period is 12000 years, the next product
being actinium. Radium gives rise to the inert gas niton (also called
radium-emanation), for which the period is a little less than 4 days.
The end of both series is a form of lead, which, so far as we know,
is not radio-active at all. There is a separate family starting from
thorium (which has the atomic number 90); this also ends in a form of
lead (atomic number 82). Some radio-active products decay so fast that
half of them die in a tiny fraction of a second. The shortest time is
estimated at a hundred-thousandth of a millionth of a second, but this
is more or less conjectural.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that, if half the atoms of a substance die in
a certain period, all will die in double that period. After half are
dead, only half as many are left to die; of these half will die in
the next period. Thus to take radium: Given a certain number of atoms
of radium, half decay in 1580 years, and half are left at the end of
that time. In the next 1580 years, half of that half will decay, and
a quarter of the original number will be left; at the end of a third
period of 1580 years, an eighth of the original number will be left,
and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>The exact circumstances which make a radio-active atom break up are
not known; we only know statistical averages. We have to suppose
that the nucleus is in more or less unstable equilibrium, and may
be disintegrated at any moment by some chance which comes, on the
average, to a certain proportion of the atoms in any given period. We
are in the same position as we should be in with human populations if
we could observe the death-rate, but were quite unable to observe the
various diseases of which people die. One point in which radio-active
substances differ from human populations is that, at the beginning
of the series, we have two substances, uranium and thorium, which
sometimes die but are never born, so far as our knowledge extends,
while at the other end we have three kinds of lead, which are born but
apparently never die. Thus the heaviest elements in the periodic series
are continually breaking down, and no process is known by which they
can be built up again. There may at one time have been many elements
with a structure more complex than that of uranium, which have broken
down so that whatever traces of them are left in the universe have
not been discovered by us. Radio-activity is one of those processes
of degeneration (in a certain technical sense) to which no converse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
process of regeneration is known. We see complex atoms breaking up, and
it is natural to suppose that there are (or have been) circumstances
under which they are put together out of simpler atoms. But no trace of
any such circumstances has been discovered. In this respect, as in some
others, the universe seems like a clock running down, with no mechanism
for winding it up again. All the uranium in the world is breaking
down, and we know of no source from which new uranium can come. Under
these circumstances it seems strange that there should be any uranium.
But if, like some insects, we lived only for a single spring day, we
should think it strange that there should be any ice in the world,
since we should find it always melting and never being formed. Perhaps
the universe has long cycles of alternate winding-up and running-down;
if so, we are in the part of the cycle in which the universe (or at
least our portion of it) runs down. Everything pleasant is associated
with this running down, because it is only this process that liberates
energy for the purposes that we regard as useful. It is time, however,
to return from these speculations to the mechanism of radio-activity.</p>

<p>When a substance is radio-active, it emits one or more of three kinds
of rays, which are called respectively <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-rays, <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-rays
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
and <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.229ex; height: 1.486ex;" src="images/17.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\gamma">-rays. It has been found that <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-rays consist
of particles, each of which is the nucleus of a helium atom;
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-rays also consist of particles, but in this case they are
electrons; <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.229ex; height: 1.486ex;" src="images/17.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\gamma">-rays do not consist of particles, but are of
the nature of light-waves, only with a very much higher frequency,
higher even (sometimes 20 times higher) than that of X-rays. We
need not further consider the <img style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.229ex; height: 1.486ex;" src="images/17.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\gamma">-rays, which do not concern
the transformations of the nucleus. It is the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-rays and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-rays that produce the results in which we are interested. We
will begin with the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-rays.</p>

<p>The <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-rays are compounded of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particles which are
nuclei of helium, and thus have a positive charge double that of
the hydrogen nucleus, and a mass (or weight) four times that of the
hydrogen nucleus. They are shot out with a velocity which may reach
to nearly a tenth of the velocity of light. Since they have a double
positive charge, they attract electrons, and therefore it is not
surprising that they tear away electrons from any atoms they may meet,
and so cause the matter on their path to become positively electrified.
When they have captured the two electrons that they desire, they
become ordinary unelectrified helium atoms. Being small and heavy and
swift, they have great power of penetration through ordinary matter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
They come from the nucleus of the atom, which thus loses two units
of positive electricity, and therefore is moved down two places in
the periodic series. At the same time the atomic weight diminishes by
four, because the helium nucleus is four times as heavy as the hydrogen
nucleus. If the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particle left the electrons of the atom
undisturbed, there would be an excess of two electrons in the atom
after its departure; but in fact it generally tears away at least two
electrons as it goes. If it loosens more than two, the atom will become
positively electrified until it can annex free electrons from its
surroundings. In the end it settles down into an ordinary unelectrified
atom of an element whose atomic number is less by two than that of the
original atom. Thus radium, which has the atomic number 88, sends out
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particles and becomes niton, with atomic number 86.</p>

<p>A substance may, however, be radio-active by sending out <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-rays
instead of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-rays. Some substances send out one kind, some
the other; a very few can send out either, and can thus give rise to
two different products of disintegration. The <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-rays are simply
very swiftly moving electrons, the most swiftly moving matter known
to us; they attain velocities which reach very nearly the velocity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
of light. They have been known to travel at the rate of about 297,000
kilometres a second, while light covers 300,000 kilometres a second. (A
kilometre is about five-eighths of a mile.) The velocity of light is a
theoretical limit, which cannot be attained by anything material, so
that we have in <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-particles velocities about as great as we can
ever expect to find in nature.</p>

<p>Since radio-activity always gives rise to a new element, and since
the element is determined by its nucleus, the <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-particles as
well as the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particles must come out of the nucleus. Since
the <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-particles are electrons, this shows that the nucleus of
a radio-active element must contain electrons. This is to be expected
in all elements, because the atomic weight increases about twice as
fast as the atomic number, so that the atomic number (which is the
net charge in the nucleus) must be the result of a number of hydrogen
nuclei about twice as great as the atomic number and a number of
electrons about equal to the atomic number. This is not always exactly
true, but at any rate it is likely to be a first approximation. There
is therefore no reason to be surprised by the fact that electrons come
out of the nuclei of radio-active elements.</p>

<p>When an electron comes out of the nucleus of an atom, it increases
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
the net charge in the nucleus by one, and therefore increases the
atomic number by one. Thus it is possible for the atomic number to be
increased by the loss of something from the nucleus, provided what is
lost is an electron. But although the atomic number is increased, the
atomic weight is not. The electron weighs so little that its loss makes
no appreciable difference to the atomic weight; moreover, since the net
charge on the nucleus is increased by one, the atom will secure another
planetary electron as soon as possible. Thus in the end the effect of
a radio-active change by the emission of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-particles ought to
be to leave the atomic weight unchanged while increasing the atomic
number by one. The result of one emission of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particles
followed by two of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-particles is thus to deprive the nucleus
of a helium nucleus and two electrons, without, in the end, changing
the atomic number. Thus uranium has two very stable forms, called
uranium I and uranium II. Uranium I is the great-grandfather of uranium
II. Uranium I, by means of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-rays, gives rise to uranium
<span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.861ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_1">,</span> of which half decays in little less than 24 days. Uranium
<img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.861ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_1"> gives rise to uranium <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.861ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/74.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_2"> by means of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-rays; half

Uranium <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.861ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/74.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_2">,</span> by
means of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-rays again, gives rise to uranium II. Uranium I and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
II both have atomic number 92; uranium <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.861ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/73.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_1"> has atomic number 90,
and uranium <img style="vertical-align: -0.339ex; width: 2.861ex; height: 1.885ex;" src="images/74.svg" alt=" " data-tex="X_2"> has atomic number 91. Thus the two stable forms
of uranium have the same atomic number although they have different
atomic weights (238 and 234). Again, the various radio-active series
all end in some form of lead; the three forms are called respectively
radium-lead, actinium-lead, and thorium-lead, after their respective
ancestors. These all have the same atomic number as ordinary lead
(82), but their atomic weights differ. Ordinary lead has the atomic
weight 207.2; radium-lead, 206.0; thorium-lead, 207.9. It is probable,
however, that ordinary lead is a mixture of two or more kinds of lead,
and perhaps this is also the case with what counts as thorium-lead. The
reason for this view is that it is now probable that every perfectly
pure element has an atomic weight which is almost exactly an integer.</p>

<p>When two elements have the same atomic number, they are called
“isotopes.” Apart from radio-activity, the only discoverable property
in which isotopes differ is atomic weight. They have the same net
charge in the nucleus, and therefore the same number of planetary
electrons, and the same possible orbits of the electrons. Consequently
their chemical properties are the same, their optical spectra are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
the same, and even their X-ray spectra are the same. All this is as
it should be according to theory. It is no wonder that the existence
of isotopes remained so long unknown. They first became known through
observations of radio-active products. But it has lately become
known, through the work of F. W. Aston, that there are many isotopes
in regions of the periodic table where radio-activity can hardly be
supposed to take place. Aston found means, in a gas containing atoms of
different weights, by which he separated the heavier and lighter atoms;
he thus obtained two pure gases out of a mixture which had hitherto
been wrongly supposed to be pure. The result was to show that atomic
weights are very approximately integers in many cases in which this
was thought not to be the case. Thus neon, which has the atomic weight
20.2, is found to consist of a mixture of two gases, one having atomic
weight 20, the other 22. Chlorine, which has the atomic weight 35.46,
is a mixture of two kinds having atomic weights 35 and 37 respectively.
Krypton turns out to consist of as many as six isotopes; xenon, of
seven, two of which however are more or less doubtful.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that in radio-activity the particles thrown off by
the nucleus consist always either of electrons or of helium nuclei.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
Not only do we never find nuclei of heavier elements than helium
thrown off, but we never find hydrogen nuclei. This is surprising,
and as yet no adequate explanation has been found. What is to be said
on this subject belongs to our next chapter. The energy displayed in
radio-activity is colossal. It shows that within the nucleus of the
atom enormous forces are concentrated. This is not surprising when
we consider that an atom as a whole is very minute, and, that the
nucleus of an atom is enormously smaller than the whole atom; that
within the nucleus of uranium about 238 hydrogen nuclei and about
146 electrons are packed together; and that these attract or repel
each other with a force which increases as the square of the distance
diminishes. The energy involved is shown by the incredible swiftness
of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particles and <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-particles. To make a body move
with the velocity of light would require a strictly infinite amount
of energy, and is therefore impossible, not only in practice but in
theory. Therefore to make ever so tiny a body as an electron move
with a velocity 99 per cent, of that of light requires a very great
amount of energy. Before the theory of relativity, the kinetic energy
of a moving particle was taken to be half the mass multiplied by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
square of the velocity; now-a-days, this has to be changed to allow
for the increase of mass with velocity. In the case of a velocity 99
per cent, of that of light, the mass is increased about seven-fold,
and the kinetic energy in the same proportion. The energy of the
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particles, owing to their greater mass, is even more than
that of the <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-particles. As Sommerfeld says:</p>

<p>“The sources of energy which are thus disclosed to the external world
are of quite a different order of magnitude from the energies of other
physical and chemical processes. They bear witness what powerful
forces are active in the interior of atoms (the nuclei). This world
of the interior of the atom is in general closed to the outer world;
it is not influenced by conditions of temperature and pressure which
hold outside; it is ruled by the law of probability, of spontaneous
chance which cannot be influenced. Only exceptionally a door opens,
which leads from the inner world of the atom into the outer world; the
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha"> or <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-rays which come out when this happens are envoys
from a world which is otherwise closed to us.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>In the next chapter, we shall give an outline of the few facts which
can be ascertained about this small fierce world in the nucleus of the
atom. Optical spectra have told us about the outer electrons, X-rays
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
about the inner rings of electrons; about the nucleus itself we know
very little except what can be learnt from radio-activity.</p>

THE STRUCTURE OF NUCLEI</h2>
</div>


<p>THE facts known about the structure of nuclei are not sufficient to
enable us to be very definite as to the way in which they are built up.
Let us begin by setting forth the facts, and then see what is to be
inferred in the way of theory.</p>

<p>The most important facts for our purpose are those of radio-activity,
which we consider in the previous chapter. We know from these facts
that the nuclei of certain heavy atoms contain helium nuclei and
electrons; that the loss of a helium nucleus diminishes the atomic
number by two and the atomic weight by four, while the loss of an
electron increases the atomic number by one and has no appreciable
effect upon the atomic weight. We know also that it is possible for
several different elements to exist with the same atomic number, but
different atomic weights; in radio-activity these can be seen in
process of formation, but they are found to exist among lighter atoms
which show no discoverable trace of radio-activity. It is possible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
that radio-activity, in a very slight degree, exists among elements
which appear to us perfectly stable; the amount of it may be so small
that we cannot hope to detect it. This may be the reason for the
existence of isotopes; but there is at present no positive evidence in
favour of this view.</p>

<p>Another fact of immense importance has been experimentally established
by Rutherford. Some elements, but not others, when submitted to a
very intense bombardment by <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particles, give off rays which
are found to be hydrogen. The element in which this result has been
established with the greatest certainty is nitrogen (atomic number 17).
But it is also fairly certain as regards a number of elements—broadly
speaking, those which have odd atomic numbers. Rutherford is led to
the conclusion that hydrogen nuclei can be detached from the nuclei
of other elements, unless their atomic weight is a multiple of 4,
which is the atomic weight of helium. This, together with the fact that
in radio-activity helium nuclei, but not hydrogen nuclei, are thrown
off, leads irresistibly to the view that every nucleus is composed,
as far as it can be, of helium nuclei. Thus, phosphorus, which has
the atomic weight 31, may be supposed to consist of seven helium
nuclei, each having atomic weight 4, and three hydrogen nuclei,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
each having atomic weight 1. The three hydrogen nuclei could, with
luck, be detached by bombardment, but the helium nuclei are to be
regarded as incapable of being destroyed by an <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particle, so
that if they are detached they are detached as wholes. Consequently,
when the atomic weight divides by 4, the nucleus can be supposed
to consist wholly of helium nuclei, and there will be no odd hydrogen
nuclei to be broken off. It is impossible to know whether Rutherford’s
bombardment breaks off helium nuclei, because they could not be
distinguished from his projectiles, which are also helium nuclei.</p>

<p>The atomic weight which we have hitherto found less important than the
atomic number, is of course of the greatest significance when we are
considering the structure of the nucleus. The weight of an electron is
so small as to be negligible in comparison with that of the nucleus,
even in the case of hydrogen, so that the weight of the atom is, to all
intents and purposes, the weight of the nucleus. If we take the weight
of the helium atom to be 4, the weight of the hydrogen atom is just
over 1. The explanation of the fact that it is not exactly 1
is very interesting, and we shall return to it shortly. The weight of
every other atom, in view of Aston’s work on isotopes, is apparently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
a whole number, as nearly as our measurements can determine. Roughly
speaking, the atomic weight is about double the atomic number. This is
true exactly in the following cases (making, in some cases, inferences
allowed by Aston’s work):</p>

<table class="autotable" >
<thead><tr>
<th class="tdc">&nbsp;</th>
<th class="tdc">Helium</th>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>After this, the atomic weight is always more than double the atomic
number. It will be seen that the above elements all have even atomic
numbers and have atomic weights which divide by 4. We may therefore
regard their nuclei as composed wholly of helium nuclei.</p>

<p>In the case of elements which have odd atomic numbers, there is only
one instance, nitrogen, in which the atomic weight (14) is just
double the atomic number (7). In this case, we may suppose that
the nucleus consists of three helium nuclei and two hydrogen nuclei.
In other cases, in the early part of the periodic table, the atomic
weight is greater by one than the double of the atomic number. Thus
phosphorus has the atomic number 15, and the atomic weight 31.
The same is true of the other early elements with odd atomic numbers,
except nitrogen. (From the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 4.034ex; height: 1.532ex;" src="images/75.svg" alt=" " data-tex="21 \text{st}"> element onward the atomic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
weight is larger than it would be by this rule.) The inference is that
the nuclei of atoms which have odd atomic numbers usually consist of an
adequate number of helium nuclei together with three hydrogen nuclei.
The peculiarity of nitrogen is perhaps connected with the fact that
Rutherford found it the easiest element from which to detach hydrogen
nuclei.</p>

<p>The fact that the atomic weights are whole numbers, together with
the facts of radio-activity and of Rutherford’s bombardment, lead
irresistibly to the conclusion that the weight of an atom is due to
helium nuclei and hydrogen nuclei which exist together in its nucleus.
The overcrowding in the nucleus of a heavy atom must be something
fearful. Radium C, which emits the <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particles that Rutherford
used in his experiments, has a nucleus whose radius is about three
million-millionths of a centimetre (about one million-millionth of an
inch). Its atomic number is 83 and its atomic weight is 214.
This means that in this tiny space it must contain 53 helium nuclei
and 2 hydrogen nuclei; it must also (as we shall see in a moment)
contain 131 electrons. It is no wonder that helium nuclei and
electrons move fast when radio-activity liberates them from this slum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>The <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-rays show that the nucleus of an atom contains electrons.
This appears also from the fact that the atomic number (which
represents the net charge of the nucleus) is less than the atomic
weight which represents the gross positive charge. (Each hydrogen
nucleus contributes one unit of positive charge.) The difference
between the atomic weight and the atomic number represents the number
of electrons there must be in the nucleus, in order to bring its net
charge down to the atomic number. In this argument, however, we have
assumed that the helium nucleus itself consists of four hydrogen nuclei
and two electrons. We have still to examine the reasons in favour of
this view.</p>

<p>There is no experimental evidence that a helium nucleus can be broken
up into hydrogen nuclei and electrons. Radio activity and Rutherford’s
bombardments show that the helium nucleus is very stable, and that no
known process will disintegrate it. Nevertheless it is believed by
all students of the subject that the helium nucleus consists of four
hydrogen nuclei and two electrons. There is first of all the argument
from the atomic weight; the weight of the helium atom is so nearly four
times the weight of the hydrogen atom that we cannot bring ourselves
to attribute this fact to chance. But why is it not <i>exactly</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
four times the weight of a hydrogen atom? If we take the weight of
a helium atom as 4, that of a hydrogen atom is not 1, but
1.008. According to every-day notions, this would be impossible if a
helium nucleus consisted of four hydrogen nuclei. (The electrons may
be ignored, as their contribution to the weight is negligible.) We are
used to thinking that if we place four pound weights in a scale, they
will weigh four pounds. This, however, is only approximately true. In
ordinary cases it is so nearly true that we could never discover the
error experimentally; but in extraordinary cases, such as the helium
nucleus, it may be sufficiently untrue for our measurements to be able
to detect the difference.</p>

<p>It used to be thought that the mass of a body (which is the scientific
conception that replaces the popular conception of weight) could be
defined as the “quantity of matter.” But Einstein has revolutionized
the conception of mass, as well as all the other elementary conceptions
of physics. Mass is now absorbed into energy, and the mass of a body
is not by any means always constant.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> A system of electrons and
hydrogen nuclei may have different amounts of energy in different
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
arrangements; when the system passes from an arrangement with more
energy to one with less, the energy it loses is radiated into the
surrounding medium, in the sort of way with which we became familiar
when we were considering the spectrum of hydrogen. When the system
loses energy it also loses mass. The loss of mass is very small
compared to the loss of energy; it is obtained by dividing the loss of
energy by half the square of the velocity of light, which is enormous.
When the system has arranged itself in a shape in which its energy
is diminished, it can only go back to its former shape if the lost
energy is supplied from outside. Therefore the shapes involving least
intrinsic energy are the most stable. This is what we must suppose to
happen when four hydrogen nuclei and two electrons come together to
make a helium nucleus. They arrange themselves in a configuration in
which their energy is less than when they were separated; the loss
of energy can be inferred from the loss of mass (or weight, to speak
popularly), and is got by multiplying this loss of mass by half the
square of the velocity of light. This represents an enormous amount of
energy. Sommerfeld calculated that it is about 10 million times greater
than the amounts involved in chemical combinations (for instance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
in combustion). The helium nucleus could only be disintegrated by
supplying this amount of energy from outside, which does not happen in
any known natural process. Thus the loss of weight in the helium atom
is accounted for, and by the same argument the extreme stability of the
helium nucleus is explained.</p>

<p>It is clear that, for the sake of unity and simplicity, it is
desirable, if possible, to regard the helium nucleus as consisting of
hydrogen nuclei and electrons. If we do not do so, we shall have to
admit the helium nucleus as a third ultimate constituent of matter,
having, by a strange coincidence, just twice the electric charge and
four times the amount of matter that exists in the hydrogen nucleus. It
must be admitted that this is a possible hypothesis; there are no known
facts that prove it to be false. But until we are forced to adopt it,
we shall prefer the simpler view that the helium nucleus is complex,
like every other except hydrogen, and that its relations of mass and
charge to the hydrogen atom are not a lucky fluke. Everything known
about nuclei is consistent with the hypothesis that they are composed
of hydrogen nuclei and electrons. The evidence that they consist of
hydrogen nuclei, electrons, and helium nuclei is overwhelming; the
further step, which dissolves the helium nucleus, is more or less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
hypothetical, but it is a step which we may take with a reasonable
assurance that it will prove justified. The study of nuclei is still in
its infancy, but is likely to make rapid advances in the near future.
Meanwhile, we may assume, though not with complete certainty, that all
matter consists of hydrogen nuclei and electrons, which are therefore
the only “elements” in the strict sense of the word. Whether these two
will ultimately prove to be modifications of some one more fundamental
substance, it is quite impossible to say. For the present, they
represent the frontier of scientific knowledge, and what lies beyond is
as yet mere speculation.</p>

<p>As to the way in which the four hydrogen nuclei and the two electrons
are arranged in the helium atom, mathematical considerations ought to
be able to give us information, but so far they have not given much.
One model which is suggestive is the following: Imagine a somewhat
primitive wheel, with four spokes, and an axle that sticks out some
distance to either side. Place the two electrons at the ends of the
axle, and the four hydrogen nuclei at the ends of the spokes, and
imagine the wheel going round with suitable velocity. (The wheel and
spokes and axle are of course imaginary, and are only intended to
illustrate the relative positions of the nuclei and electrons.) This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
gives a configuration which has a certain degree of stability, and a
fattish shape which is indicated by a certain amount of experimental
evidence. It seems, however, that the degree of stability in this
model is less than that required to account for the fact that no
known process will disintegrate a helium nucleus. There is also a
difficulty as regards the size of the helium nucleus. Taking our model
and applying the quantum theory to the revolutions of the hydrogen
nuclei, we can determine the radius of the circle in which they move
as we determined the minimum orbit in the hydrogen atom. The result
is that the size of the radius should be about 5 million-millionths
of a centimetre. This is about seventeen times too large, according
to Rutherford’s experimental evidence. It is possible, nevertheless,
that our model may be right, because the forces between electrons and
hydrogen nuclei may obey different laws, at such very tiny distances,
from those which they obey at ordinary distances. We may hope to know
more on this subject at no distant date, but for the present we must
remain in doubt.</p>

THE NEW PHYSICS AND THE WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT</h2>
</div>


<p>IN the physics of the atom, as it has become in modern times,
everything is atomic, and there are sudden jumps from one condition to
another. The electron and the hydrogen nucleus are the true “atoms”
both of electricity and of matter. According to the quantum theory,
there are also atomic quantities, not of energy as was thought when
the theory was first suggested, but of what is called “action.” The
word “action,” in physics, has a precise technical meaning; it may be
regarded as the result of energy operating for a certain time. Thus
if a given amount of energy operates for two seconds, there is twice
as much action as if it operated for one second; if it operates for
a minute, there is 60 times as much action, and so on. If twice the
amount of energy operates for a second, there is again twice as much
action, and so on. If the energy which is operating is variable, and we
wish to estimate its action during a given time, we divide the time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
into a number of little bits, during each of which the energy will
vary so little that it may be regarded as constant; we then multiply
the energy during each little interval of time by the length of the
interval, and add up for all the intervals. As we make the intervals
smaller and more numerous, the result of our addition approaches nearer
and nearer to a certain limit; this limit we define as the total action
during the total period of time concerned. Action is a very important
conception in physics; from the point of view of theory it is more
important than energy, which has been deposed from its eminence by
the theory of relativity. Planck’s quantum <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> is of the nature of
action; thus the quantum theory amounts to saying that there are atoms
of action.</p>

<p>So long as we confine ourselves to what goes on in matter, this theory
is self-consistent and explains the facts, nor is it easy to suppose
that any theory which was not atomic would explain the facts. But
when we come to what goes on in “empty space,” or in the “æther,” we
find ourselves in difficulties if we adhere to the quantum theory.
Consider what happens when a wave of light is sent out by an atom,
with only one quantum of action in each period. The wave spreads out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
in all directions, growing fainter as it goes on, like a ripple when
a stone is dropped into a pond. The evidence that light consists of
waves remains quite unshaken; it is derived from the phenomena of
interference and diffraction. As to interference, a few words may be
necessary. If two sets of waves are travelling more or less in the same
direction, if their crests come together they will grow bigger, but if
the crest of one comes in the same place as the trough of the other,
they will neutralize each other. Now it is possible to arrange two sets
of light-waves so that in some places their crests come together, while
in others the one covers the trough of the other. When this is done,
we get a lattice pattern of alternate light and darkness, light where
the waves reinforce each other, and darkness where they neutralize each
other. If light consisted of particles travelling, and not of waves,
this phenomenon, which is called “interference,” could not take place.</p>

<p>The difficulties which arise for the quantum-theory out of the
phenomenon of interference have been forcibly stated by Jeans in the
following paragraphs:<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>“If light occurred only in quanta, interference could only occur at a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
point at which two or more quanta existed simultaneously. If the light
were sufficiently feeble the simultaneous occurrence of two or more
quanta at any point ought to be a very rare occurrence, so that all
phenomena, such as diffraction patterns, which depend on interference,
ought to disappear as the quantity of light present is reduced. Taylor
has shown that this is not the case; he reduced the intensity of his
light to such an extent that an exposure of 2,000 hours was necessary
to obtain a photograph, and yet obtained photographs of diffraction
patterns in which the alternation of light and dark appeared with
undiminished sharpness. In Taylor’s experiment the intensity of light
was ... about one light-quantum per 10,000 cubic centimetres, so
that if the quanta had been concentrated nothing of the nature of a
diffraction could possibly have been observed.”</p>

<p>“Thus it appears that there is no hope of reconciling the undulatory
theory of light with the quantum-theory by regarding the undulatory
theory as being, so to speak, only statistically true when a great
number of quanta are present. One theory cannot be the limit of the
other in the sense in which the Newtonian mechanics is the limit of the
quantum-mechanics, and we are faced with the problem of combining two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
apparently quite irreconcilable theories.”</p>

<p>Other similar difficulties might be mentioned, but the difficulty of
interference may suffice, since it is typical. It may be questioned
whether the difficulty still exists when the quantum theory is stated
in the form which it takes in Sommerfeld’s work. We no longer have
little parcels of energy; what we have is a property of periodic
processes. It would not be accurate to state this property in the
form: the total action throughout a complete period of any periodic
process is <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> or an exact multiple of <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h">.</span> But although this
statement would not be accurate, it gives, as nearly as is possible
in non-mathematical language, a general idea of the sort of thing
that is affirmed by the modern form of the quantum theory. In order
to reconcile this principle with the facts about the diffusion of
light, it is only necessary to avoid dividing the æther into imaginary
particles. As the light-wave travels outward, so long as it meets no
obstruction its energy remains constant, though it is more diffused, so
that there is less of it in any given area of the wave-front. But while
we remain in empty space, the wave must be treated as a whole, and
the quantum-theory must not be applied to separate little bits of it.
The quantum theory has to do, not with what is happening in a point
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
at an instant, but with what happens to a periodic process throughout
its whole period. Just as the period occupies a certain finite time,
so the process occupies a certain finite space; and in the case of
a light-wave travelling outward from a source of light, the finite
space occupied by the process grows larger as it travels away from the
source. For the purposes of stating the quantum principle, one period
of a periodic process has to be treated as an indivisible whole. This
was not evident at the time when Jean’s report was written (1914),
but has been made evident by subsequent developments. While it makes
the quantum principle more puzzling, it also prevents it from being
inconsistent with the known facts about light.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the quantum principle in its modern form is
far more astonishing and bewildering than is its older form. It might
have seemed odd that energy should exist in little indivisible parcels,
but at any rate it was an idea that could be grasped. But in the
modern form of the principle, nothing is said, in the first instance,
about what is going on at a given moment, or about atoms of energy
existing at all times, but only about the total result of a process
that takes time. Every periodic process arranges itself so as to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
achieved a certain amount by the time one period is completed. This
seems to show that nature has a kind of foresight, and also knows the
integral calculus, without which it is impossible to know how fast to
go at each instant so as to achieve a certain result in the end. All
this sounds incredible. No doubt the fact is that the principle has
assumed a complicated form because it has forced its way through, owing
to experimental evidence, in a science built upon totally different
notions. The revolution in physical notions introduced by Einstein
has as yet by no means produced its full effect. When it has, it is
probable that the quantum principle will take on some simple and easily
intelligible form. But it will only be easily intelligible to those who
have gone through the labour of learning to think in terms of modern
physical notions rather than in terms of the notions derived from
common sense and embodied in traditional physics. In the last chapter
of this book we shall try to indicate the sort of way in which this may
affect the quantum principle.</p>

<p>It is necessary, however, to utter a word of warning, in case readers
should accept as a dogmatic ultimate truth the atomic structure of
the world which we have been describing, and which seems at present
probable. It should not be forgotten that there is another order
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
of ideas, temporarily out of fashion, which may at any moment come
back into favour if it is found to afford the best explanation of the
phenomena. The charge on an electron, the equal and opposite charge
on a hydrogen atom, the mass of an electron, the mass of a hydrogen
nucleus, and Planck’s quantum, all appear in modern physics as absolute
constants, which are just brute facts for which no reason can be
imagined. The æther, which used to play a great part in physics, has
sunk into the background, and has become as shadowy as Mrs. Harris.
It may be found, however, as a result of further research, that the
æther is after all what is really fundamental, and that electrons
and hydrogen nuclei are merely states of strain in the æther, or
something of the sort. If so, the two “elements” with which modern
physics operates may be reduced to one, and the atomic character of
matter may turn out to be not the ultimate truth. This suggestion is
purely speculative; there is nothing in the existing state of physics
to justify it. But the past history of science shows that it should
be borne in mind as a possibility to be tested hereafter. If the
possibility should be realized, it would not mean that the present
theory is false; it would merely mean that a new interpretation had
been found for its results. Our imagination is so incurably concrete
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
and pictorial that we have to express scientific laws, as soon as we
depart from the language of mathematics, in language which asserts much
more than we <i>mean</i> to assert. We speak of an electron as if it
were a little hard lump of matter, but no physicist really means to
assert that it is. We speak of it as if it had a certain size, but that
also is more than we really mean. It may be something more analogous
to a noise, which is spread throughout a certain region, but with
diminishing intensity as we travel away from the source of the noise.
So it is possible that an electron is a certain kind of disturbance
in the æther, most intense at one spot, and diminishing very rapidly
in intensity as we move away from the spot. If a disturbance of this
sort could be discovered which would move and change as the electron
does, and have the same amount of energy as the electron has, and
have periodic changes of the same frequency as those of the electron,
physics could regard it as what an electron really is without
contradicting anything that present-day physics means to assert. And of
course it is equally possible that a hydrogen nucleus may come to be
explained in a similar way. All this is however, merely a speculative
possibility; there is not as yet any evidence making it either
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
probable or improbable. The only thing that is probable is that there
will be such evidence, one way or other, before many years have passed.</p>

THE NEW PHYSICS AND RELATIVITY</h2>
</div>


<p>THE theory of quanta and the theory of relativity have been derived
from very different classes of phenomena. The theory of quanta is
concerned with the smallest quantities known to science, the theory of
relativity with the largest. Distances too small for the microscope
are concerned in the theory of quanta; distances too large for the
telescope are concerned in the theory of relativity. Relativity came,
in the first instance, from astronomy and the study of the propagation
of light in astronomical spaces, and its most noteworthy triumphs have
been in regard to astronomical phenomena—the motion of the perihelion
of Mercury, and the bending of light from the stars when it passes near
the sun. The material of the quantum theory, on the contrary, is mainly
derived from small quantities of very rarefied gases in laboratories,
and from tiny particles running about in a vacuum as nearly perfect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
as we can make it. In the theory of relativity, 300,000 kilometres
counts as a small distance; in the theory of quanta, a thousandth of a
centimetre counts as infinitely great. The result of this divergence is
that two theories have been pursued by different investigators, because
they required different apparatus and different methods. In this final
chapter, we shall consider what bearing the two theories have on each
other, and, in particular, whether there is anything in relativity that
makes the theory of quanta seem less odd and irrational.</p>

<p>The theory of relativity, as every one knows, was discovered by
Einstein in two stages, of which the first is called the special
theory and the second the general theory. The first dates from 1905,
the second from 1915. The first is not superseded by the second, but
absorbed into it as a part. We shall not attempt to explain the theory
of relativity, which has been done popularly (so far as is possible) in
a multitude of books and scientifically in two books which should be
read by all who have sufficient mathematical equipment: Hermann Weyl’s
<i>Space, Time, Matter</i>, and Eddington’s <i>Mathematical Theory of
Relativity</i>. We are only concerned with the points where this theory
touches the problem of atomic structure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>The special theory of relativity, as we have already seen, is
relevant to the problems we have been considering at several points.
It is relevant through its doctrine that mass, as measured by our
instruments, varies with velocity, and is, in fact, merely a part of
the energy of a body. It is part of the theory of relativity to show
that the results of measurement, in a great many cases do not yield
physical facts about the quantities intended to be measured, but
are dependent upon the relative motion of the observer and what is
observed. Since motion is a purely relative thing, we cannot say that
the observer is standing still while the object observed is moving;
we can only say that the two are moving relatively to each other. It
follows that any quantity which depends upon the motion of a body
relatively to the observer cannot be regarded as an intrinsic property
of the body. Mass, as commonly measured, is such a property; if the
body is moving with a velocity which approaches that of light, its
measured mass increases, and as the velocity gets nearer to that of
light, the measured mass increases without limit. But this increase
of mass is only apparent; it would not exist for an observer moving
with the body whose mass is being measured. The mass as measured by an
observer moving with the body is what counts as the true mass, and it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
is easily inferred from the measured mass when we know how the body
concerned is moving relatively to ourselves. When we say that any two
electrons have the same mass, or that any two hydrogen nuclei have
the same mass, we are speaking of the true mass. The apparent mass of
an electron which is shot out in the form of a <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\beta">-ray may be
several times as great as the true mass.</p>

<p>There are two other points where the variability of apparent mass is
relevant in the theory of atoms. One concerns the “fine structure”
and the analogy between the electron in a hydrogen atom and the
planet Mercury; this was considered in <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII</a>. The other is the
explanation of the fact that the helium nucleus is less than four times
as heavy as the hydrogen nucleus, which concerned us in <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">Chapter XI</a>. On
both these points, as we have seen, the theory of relativity provides
admirably satisfactory explanations of facts which would otherwise
remain obscure. Both, however, raise the question of the relativity of
energy, which might be thought awkward for the quantum theory, because
this theory uses the conservation of energy, and something merely
relative to the observer cannot be expected to be conserved.</p>

<p>In elementary dynamics, as every one knows, energy consists of two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
parts, kinetic and potential. Ignoring the latter, let us consider the
former. The kinetic energy depends upon the mass and the velocity,
but the velocity depends upon the observer, and is not an intrinsic
property of a body. The result is that energy has to be defined in the
theory of relativity. It turns out that we can identify the energy of a
body with its mass as measured by the observer (or, in ordinary units,
with this mass multiplied by the square of the velocity of light).
Although, for a particular body, this mass varies with the observer,
its sum throughout the universe will be constant for a given observer,
however he may be moving.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In the theory of relativity, there are two kinds of variation of mass
to be distinguished, of which so far we have only considered one.</p>

<p>We have considered the change of measured mass (as we have called
it) which is brought about by a change in the relative motion of the
observer and the body whose mass is being measured. This is not a
change in the body itself, but merely in its relation to the observer.
It is this change which has to be allowed for in deducing from
experimental data that all electrons have the same mass. We allow for
it by means of a formula, which enables us to infer what we may call
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
the “proper mass” of the body. This is the mass which it will be found
to have by an observer who shares its motion. In all ordinary cases,
in which we determine mass (or weight) by means of a balance, we and
the body which we are weighing share the same motion, namely that of
the earth in its rotation and revolution; thus weighing with a balance
gives the “proper mass.” But in the case of swiftly-moving electrons
and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.448ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\alpha">-particles we have to adopt other ways of measuring their
mass, because we cannot make ourselves move as fast as they do; thus
in these cases we only arrive at the “proper mass” by a calculation.
The “proper mass” is a genuine property of a body, not relative to the
observer. As a rule, the proper mass is constant, or very nearly so,
but it is not always strictly constant. When a body absorbs radiant
energy, its proper mass is increased; when it radiates out energy, its
proper mass is diminished. When four hydrogen nuclei and two electrons
combine to form a helium nucleus, they radiate out energy. The loss of
mass involved is loss of proper mass, and is quite a different kind of
phenomenon from the variation of measured mass when an electron changes
its velocity.</p>

<p>There is another point, not easy to explain clearly, and as yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
amounting to no more than a suggestion, but capable of proving very
important in the future. We saw that Planck’s quantum <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> is not
a certain amount of energy, but a certain amount of what is called
“action.” Now the theory of relativity would lead us to expect that
action would be more important than energy. The reason for this is
derived from the fact that relativity diminishes the gulf between space
and time which exists in popular thought and in traditional physics.
How this affects our question we must now try to understand.</p>

<p>Consider two events, one of which happens at noon on one day in London,
while the other happens at noon the next day in Edinburgh. Common
sense would say that there are two kinds of intervals between these
two events, an interval of 24 hours in time, and an interval of 400
miles in space. The theory of relativity says that this is a mistake,
and that there is only one kind of interval between them, which may be
analyzed into a space-part and a time-part in a number of different
ways. One way will be adopted by a person who is not moving relatively
to the events concerned, while other ways will be adopted by persons
moving in various ways. If a comet were passing near the earth when
our two events happened, and were moving very fast relatively to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
earth, an observer on the comet would divide the interval of our two
events differently between space and time, although, if he knew the
theory of relativity, he would arrive at the same estimate of the
total interval as would be made by our relativity physicists. Thus the
division of the interval into a space portion and a time portion does
not belong to the physical relation of the two events, but is something
subjective, contributed by the observer. It cannot, therefore, enter
into the correct statement of any law of the physical world.</p>

<p>The importance of this principle (which is supported by a multitude of
empirical facts) is impossible to exaggerate. It means, in the first
place, that the ultimate facts in physics must be events, rather than
bodies in motion. A body is supposed to persist through a certain
length of time, and its motion is only definite when we have fixed
upon one way of dividing intervals between space and time. Therefore
any physical statement in terms of the motions of bodies is in part
conventional and subjective, and must contain an element not belonging
to the physical occurrence. We have therefore to deal with events,
whose relative positions, in the conventional space-time system that
we have adopted, are fixed by four quantities, three giving their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
relations in space (e.g. east-and-west, north-and-south, up-and-down),
while the fourth gives their relation in time. The true interval
between them can be calculated from these, and is the same whatever
conventional system we adopt; just as the time-interval between two
historical events would be the same whether we dated both by the
Christian era or by the Mohammedan, only that the calculation is not so
simple.</p>

<p>It follows from these considerations that, when we wish to consider
what is happening in some very small region (as we have to do whenever
we apply the differential or integral calculus), we must not take
merely a small region of space, but a small region of space-time, i.e.
in conventional language, what is happening in a small volume of space
during a very short time. This leads us to consider, not merely the
energy at an instant, but the effect of energy operating for a very
short time; and this, as we saw, is of the nature of action (in the
technical sense). A quotation from Eddington<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> will help to make the
point clear:</p>

<p>“After mass and energy there is one physical quantity which plays
a very fundamental part in modern physics, known as <i>Action</i>.
<i>Action</i> here is a very technical term, and is not to be confused
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
with Newton’s ‘Action and Reaction.’ In the relativity theory in
particular this seems in many respects to be the most fundamental
thing of all. The reason is not difficult to see. If we wish to speak
of the continuous matter present at any particular point of space
and time, we must use the term <i>density</i>. Density multiplied by
volume in space gives us <i>mass</i> or, what appears to be the same
thing, <i>energy</i>. But from our space-time point of view, a far more
important thing is density multiplied by a four-dimensional volume of
space and time; this is <i>action</i>. The multiplication by three
dimensions gives mass or energy; and the fourth multiplication gives
mass or energy multiplied by time. Action is thus mass multiplied
by time, or energy multiplied by time, and is more fundamental than
either.”</p>

<p>It is a fact which must be significant that action thus turns out to
be fundamental both in relativity theory and in the theory of quanta.
But as yet it is impossible to say what is the interpretation to be put
upon this fact; we shall probably have to wait for some new and more
fundamental way of stating the quantum theory.</p>

<p>There is one other respect in which some of the later developments
of relativity suggest the possibility of answers to questions which
have hitherto seemed quite unanswerable. Our theory, so far, leads us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
to brute facts which have to be merely accepted. We do not know why
there are two kinds of electricity, or why opposite kinds attract each
other while similar kinds repel each other. This dualism is one of the
things which is intellectually unsatisfying about the present condition
of physics. Another thing is the conflict between the discontinuous
process by which energy is radiated from the atom into the surrounding
medium, and the continuous process by which it is transmitted through
the surrounding medium. Relativity throws very little light on these
points, but there is another point upon which it throws at least
a glimmer. We find it hard to rest content with the existence of
unrelated absolute constants, such as Planck’s quantum and the size of
an electron, which, so far as we can see, might just as easily have
had any different magnitude. To the scientific mind, such facts are a
challenge, leading to a search for some way of inter-relating them and
making them seem less accidental. As regards the quantum, no plausible
suggestion has yet been made. But as regards the size of an electron,
Eddington makes some suggestive observations, which, however, require
some preliminary explanations.</p>

<p>We saw that, according to the theory of relativity, the interval
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
between two events may be separated into a time-part and a space-part
in various ways, all of which are equally legitimate, and each of
which will seem natural to an observer who is moving suitably. The
first effect of this is to diminish the sharpness of the distinction
between space and time. But the distinction comes back in a new
form. It is found that the interval between two events can, in some
cases, be regarded as merely a space-interval; this will happen if an
observer who is moving suitably would regard them as simultaneous.
Whenever this does not happen, the interval can be regarded as merely a
time-interval; this will be the case when an observer could travel so
as to be present at both events. It takes eight minutes for light to
travel from the sun to the earth, and nothing can travel faster than
light; therefore if we consider some event which happens on the earth
at 12 noon, any event which happens on the sun between 11.52 a. m. and
12.8 p. m. could not have happened in the presence of anything which
was present at the event on earth at 12 noon. Events happening on the
sun during these 16 minutes have an interval from the event on earth
which will, for a suitable observer, seem to be a spatial separation
between simultaneous events; such intervals are called space-like.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
Events happening earlier or later than these 16 minutes will be
separated from the event on earth at noon by an interval which would
appear to be purely temporal to an observer who had spent the interval
in travelling from the sun to the earth, or vice versa as the case may
be; such intervals are called time-like. Two parts of one light-ray are
on the borderland between time-like and space-like intervals, and in
fact the interval between them is zero. But in all other cases there is
a separation which is either time-like or space-like, and in this way
we find that there is still a distinction between what is to be called
temporal and what is to be called spatial, though the distinction is
different from that of every-day life.</p>

<p>For reasons which we cannot go into, Einstein and others have suggested
that the universe has a “curvature,” so that we could theoretically go
all round it and come back to our starting-point, in the sort of way in
which we go round the earth. All the way round the universe, in that
case, must be a certain length, fixed in nature. Eddington suggests
that some relation will probably be found between this, the greatest
length in nature, and the radius of the electron, which is the least
length in nature. As he humorously puts it: “An electron could never
decide how large it ought to be unless there existed some length
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
independent of itself for it to compare itself with.”</p>

<p>He goes on to make another application of this principle, which is
suggestive, though perhaps not intended to be treated too solemnly. The
curvature of the universe, if it exists, is only in space, not in time.
This leads him to say:<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>“By consideration of extension in time-like directions we obtain a
confirmation of these views which is, I think, not entirely fantastic.
We have said that an electron would not know how large it ought to be
unless there existed independent lengths in space for it to measure
itself against. Similarly it would not know how long it ought to exist
unless there existed a length in time for it to measure itself against.
But there is not radius of curvature in a time-like direction; so the
electron does <i>not</i> know how long it ought to exist. Therefore it
just goes on existing indefinitely.”</p>

<p>But even if the size of an electron should ultimately prove, in this
way, to be related to the size of the universe, that would leave a
number of unexplained brute facts, notably the quantum itself, which
has so far defied all attempts to make it seem anything but accidental.
It is <i>possible</i> that the desire for rational explanation may be
carried too far. This is suggested by some remarks, also by Eddington,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
in his book, <i>Space, Time and Gravitation</i> (p. 200). The theory
of relativity has shown that most of traditional dynamics, which was
supposed to contain scientific laws, really consisted of conventions
as to measurement, and was strictly analogous to the “great law” that
there are always three feet to a yard. In particular, this applies to
the conservation of energy. This makes it plausible to suppose that
every apparent law of nature which strikes us as reasonable is not
really a law of nature, but a concealed convention, plastered on to
nature by our love of what we, in our arrogance, choose to consider
rational. Eddington hints that a real law of nature is likely to stand
out by the fact that it appears to us irrational, since in that case
it is less likely that we have invented it to satisfy our intellectual
taste. And from this point of view he inclines to the belief that
the quantum-principle is the first real law of nature that has been
discovered in physics.</p>

<p>This raises a somewhat important question: Is the world “rational,”
i.e., such as to conform to our intellectual habits? Or is it
“irrational,” i.e., not such as we should have made it if we had been
in the position of the Creator? I do not propose to suggest an answer
to this question.</p>

BOHR’S THEORY OF THE HYDROGEN SPECTRUM</h2>
</div>


<p>THE mathematics involved in this theory is so simple that only a very
slight acquaintance with elementary dynamics is required in order to
understand it.</p>

<p>Let us consider an electron revolving in a circle about the nucleus.
Let <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/76.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m"> be the mass of the electron, a the radius of its orbit,
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.407ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/77.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\omega"> its angular velocity. Also let <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/78.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> be the (negative)
charge on the electron and the (positive) charge on the nucleus.</p>

<p>Then according to elementary dynamics, the centrifugal force of the
electron in its orbit is
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 5.578ex; height: 2.025ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
ma \omega^{2}
"></span>
while the force attracting it to the nucleus is
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.651ex; width: 3.18ex; height: 5.068ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{e^{2}}{a^{2}}
"></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
by Coulomb’s Law. These two must be equal, so that
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.651ex; width: 19.192ex; height: 5.068ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
ma \omega^{2} = \frac{e^{2}}{a^{2}}
\qquad \text{(1)}
"></span>
So far, we have been proceeding on traditional lines. But we come now
to the application of the quantum theory.</p>

<p>The kinetic energy of the electron is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 7.705ex; height: 4.588ex;" src="images/79.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{1}{2}ma \omega^{2}">;</span>
the potential energy is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.575ex; width: 4.798ex; height: 4.991ex;" src="images/80.svg" alt=" " data-tex="-\dfrac{e^{2}}{a}">.</span> In virtue of the above
equation, <img style="vertical-align: -1.575ex; width: 3.037ex; height: 4.991ex;" src="images/81.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{e^{2}}{a}"> is double <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 7.705ex; height: 4.588ex;" src="images/79.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{1}{2}ma \omega^{2}">,</span>
so that the total energy is equal to the kinetic energy with its sign
changed. The impulse corresponding to <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.407ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/77.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\omega"> is <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 5.578ex; height: 1.912ex;" src="images/82.svg" alt=" " data-tex="ma^{2} \omega">,</span>
and this has to be taken round one complete circuit of the orbit. This
yields the value <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 7.999ex; height: 1.912ex;" src="images/83.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2 \pi ma^{2} \omega">,</span> which must be put equal to a
multiple of <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h">,</span> say <span class="nowrap"><img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.661ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/53.svg" alt=" " data-tex="nh">,</span> where <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.357ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/54.svg" alt=" " data-tex="n"> is an integer. Thus we have
the equation

Now <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/76.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/78.svg" alt=" " data-tex="e"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="h"> are known; thus (1) and (2) determine

The smallest possible orbit is got by putting
